If your deep learning project requires graph
analytics and other important algorithms,

then Dato GraphLab Create might be a good
choice. GraphLab is a software platform that

offers two deep nets and a whole host of machine
learning and graph algorithms. Let’s take

a closer look.

GraphLab offers you two different types of
deep nets, depending on the nature of your

input data. If you supply GraphLab with image
data, the default selection will be a convolutional

net. With any other kind of data, the default
is a multilayer perceptron. In addition to

deep nets, the platform has several built-in
machine learning algorithms including text

analytics, a recommender, classification,
regression, and clustering. And as the name

suggests, they also provide Graph Analytics
tools, which is unique among deep net platforms.

in your deep learning projects? Please comment

and let me know your thoughts.

Just like the H2O platform, GraphLab provides
a great set of data munging features. It provides

built-in integration for SQL databases, Hadoop,
Spark, Amazon S3, Pandas data frames, and

many others.

GraphLab also offers an intuitive UI for model
management. In addition to this, GraphLab

Canvas allows you to create sophisticated
visualizations of your model’s results.

GraphLab Create is provided as a downloadable
software package, so it will need to be deployed

and managed on your own hardware infrastructure.

GraphLab offers three different types of built-in
storage, all of which are open source. There

is SArray, which is a columnar representation.
Then there is SFrame, a tabular storage model.

And finally there is SGraph, the graph model.
According to the platform’s website, these

tools are designed to handle terabytes of
data analysis at interactive speeds.

An important note is that the GraphLab Create
platform supports the use of GPUs. As we’ve

previously seen, this feature is becoming
increasingly important for Deep Learning applications.

You can use the GraphLab models to build different
types of predictive analytics tools, which

can then be set up as services. These services
can be accessed programmatically through an

API on your computer or mobile device.

The information on GraphLab’s website is
a bit limited, so you may have to sift through

the API’s documentation in order to see
if the platform is a good fit for your project.

Up next, we’ll start looking into Deep Learning
Libraries.
