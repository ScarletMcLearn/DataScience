If you need a library for a machine vision
or a forecasting application, then Caffe might

be a good choice. This library lets you build
your own deep nets with a sophisticated set

of layer configuration options. You can even
access premade nets that were uploaded to

a community website. Let’s take a look.

The Caffe Deep Learning Library was created
by Google’s Yangqing Jia, who won an ImageNet

Challenge in 2014.

Caffe was originally designed for machine
vision tasks, so it’s well-suited for convolutional

nets. However, recent versions of the library
provide support for speech and text, reinforcement

learning, and recurrent nets for sequence
processing. Since the library is written in

C++ with CUDA, applications can easily switch
between a CPU and a GPU as needed. Matlab

and Python interfaces are also available for
Caffe.

With Caffe, you can build a deep net by configuring
its hyper-parameters. In fact, the layer configuration

options are very sophisticated. You can create
a net with many different types of layers,

such as a vision layer, a loss layer, an activation
layer, and a few others. So each layer can

perform a different function or take on a
different role. This flexibility allows you

to develop extremely complex deep nets for
your application. Caffe is supported by a

large community where users can contribute
their own deep net to a repository known as

the “Model Zoo”. AlexNet and GoogleNet
are two popular user-made nets available to

the community. There are also a few educational
resources like demos and slides, so if you’re

going to use Caffe, it’s a great place to
start.

Caffe vectorizes input data through a special
data representation called a “blob”. A

“blob” is a type of array that speeds
up data analysis and provides synchronization

capabilities between a CPU and a GPU.

Have you ever used the Caffe library in one
of your own Deep Net projects? Please comment

and share your experiences.
