This makes this an interesting dataset for doing NLP work. It is data written by users, so it's like that there are various typos, nonstandard spellings, and other variations that you may not find in curated sets of published text.\n\nIn this notebook, I will do some very simple text processing and then try out two fairly unoptimized deep learning models:\n1. A convolutional neural net\n2.
