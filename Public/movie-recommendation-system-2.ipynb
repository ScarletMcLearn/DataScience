    "Taking the cast, director, country, rating and genres as features rather than the descriptions was definitely the better option. Some of the recommendations by descriptions are good such as the 'Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast' recommendation for 'Hook' and the 'Extracurricular' recommendation for '13 Reasons Why', but most of them are from completely different genres with very little in common besides a few key words."
