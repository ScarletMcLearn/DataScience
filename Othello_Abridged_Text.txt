['RODERIGO', 'By God, I’d rather be his executioner.']
['IAGO', 'And there’s nothing I can do about it. \t\t\tThat’s the curse of military service. You get promoted \t\t\twhen someone likes you, not because you’re next in line. \t\t\tNow, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?']
['RODERIGO', 'If you don’t like him you should quit.']
['IAGO', 'No, calm down. I’m serving under him to take advantage \t\t\tof him. We can’t all be masters, and not all masters \t\t\tshould be followed. Look at all the devoted servants who work for \t\t\ttheir masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then \t\t\twhen they get old they’re terminated. They ought to be \t\t\twhipped for being so stupid. But then there’s another \t\t\tkind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but who’s \t\t\treally looking out for himself. By pretending to serve their lords, \t\t\tthese men get rich, and when they’ve saved up enough they \t\t\tcan be their own masters. Guys like that have soul, and \t\t\tthat’s the kind of guy I am. Let me tell']
['RODERIGO', ' Thick-lips“Thick-lips” is a racial slur toward the Moor, Othello.Thick-lips sure is lucky if he can pull this off!']
['IAGO', 'Let’s shout up to Desdemona’s father, wake \t\t\thim, pester him, spoil his happiness, spread rumors about him in the \t\t\tstreets, enrage his relatives, and irritate him endlessly. However \t\t\treal his happiness is, it will vanish in light of this.']
['RODERIGO', 'Here’s her father’s house. I’ll \t\t\tcall out.']
['IAGO', 'Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.']
['RODERIGO', 'Hey, Brabantio! Signor Brabantio, hey!']
['IAGO', 'Wake up, Brabantio! Wake up! Thieves! Thieves! Check on your \t\t\tdaughter, your house, your money! Thieves! Thieves!']
['BRABANTIO', 'What’s the reason for this horrible shouting? \t\t\tWhat’s the matter?']
['RODERIGO', 'Sir, is everyone in your family at home?']
['IAGO', 'Are your doors locked?']
['BRABANTIO', 'Why are you asking me that?']
['IAGO', 'For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed. Get \t\t\tdressed. Your heart’s going to break. It’s \t\t\tlike half your soul’s been ripped out. At this very \t\t\tminute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb. \t\t\tWake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens. \t\t\tIf you wait too long you’ll have black grandchildren. Get \t\t\tup, I tell you!']
['BRABANTIO', 'Are you crazy?']
['RODERIGO', 'Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?']
['BRABANTIO', 'Not me. Who are you?']
['RODERIGO', 'My name’s Roderigo.']
['BRABANTIO', 'I told you not to hang around my house. I’ve already \t\t\ttold you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you. Now \t\t\tyou come here drunk to make trouble and startle me out of a sound \t\t\tsleep?']
['RODERIGO', 'Sir, sir, sir—']
['BRABANTIO', 'You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for \t\t    this.']
['RODERIGO', 'Please wait, sir.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Why are you talking about robbery? This is Venice. My house \t\t\tisn’t in some remote countryside.']
['RODERIGO', 'Brabantio, with all due respect, I’m here out of \t\t\tcourtesy and good will. I’ve come to tell \t\t    you—']
['IAGO', 'My God, sir, you’re stubborn and suspicious. We come \t\t\there to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African \t\t\thorse climb all over your daughter. Your grandsons will neigh to you \t\t\tlike horses. Your whole family will be ruined.']
['BRABANTIO', 'What kind of crude jerk are you?']
['IAGO', 'The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your \t\t\tdaughter right now.']
['BRABANTIO', 'You’re a villain!']
['IAGO', 'You’re a senator!']
['BRABANTIO', 'You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo. I know who you \t\t\tare.']
['RODERIGO', 'I’ll answer for everything. I don’t know if \t\t\tyou know or approve of this, but in the wee hours of the morning \t\t\tyour daughter left your house, with no better escort than a hired \t\t\tgondolier, to go into the rough embrace of a lustful Moor. If all of \t\t\tthis happened with your']
['BRABANTIO', 'Light the candles! Wake up my whole household! I dreamt about \t\t\tthis. I’m starting to worry it’s true. Give me \t\t\tsome light!']
['IAGO', ' (to RODERIGO) ']
['BRABANTIO', 'It’s true. She’s gone. The rest of my life \t\t\twill be nothing but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, where did you see \t\t\ther?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you \t\t\tsaw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a \t\t\tfather?—How did you know it was her?—To think \t\t\tshe tricked me so easily!—What did she say to \t\t\tyou?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives. \t\t\tDo you think they’re married?']
['RODERIGO', 'Yes, I really think so.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Oh, heaven, how did she get out? My own flesh and blood rebels \t\t\tagainst me! Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they \t\t\tact obedient and innocent. Are there magic spells that can lead \t\t\tyoung virgins astray? Have you ever heard of anything like that, \t\t\tRoderigo?']
['RODERIGO', 'Yes, sir, I have.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Call my brother.—Now I wish you’d married \t\t\ther!—Some of you go one way, some the other \t\t\tway.—Do you know where we can find her and the \t\t    Moor?']
['RODERIGO', 'I think I can find him. Get together a group of armed men and \t\t\tfollow me.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Lead the way. I’ll stop at every house. I’m \t\t\trespected enough that most of them will do what I \t\t\tsay.—Get your weapons! And get the officers who guard the \t\t\tcity at night.—Let’s go, Roderigo. \t\t\tI’ll reward you for your troubles.']
['IAGO', 'I’ve killed many men in battle, but I still believe \t\t\tit’s deeply wrong to murder someone. Sometimes I worry \t\t\tI’m not cruel enough for this job. Nine or ten times I \t\t\twanted to stab him under the ribs.']
['OTHELLO', 'It’s better that you didn’t kill him.']
['IAGO', 'But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such \t\t\tinsulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain \t\t\tmyself. But please tell me, sir, is your marriage secureIago may be asking whether Othello has consummated his marriage by sleeping with Desdemona yet. A marriage could be annulled if it had never been consummated.secure? Brabantio \t\t\tis an important man in this city, almost as powerful as the duke \t\t\thimself. He’ll try to annul your marriage, or else \t\t\tinflict whatever punishment the law and his power will allow him to.']
['OTHELLO', 'Let him do his worst. The services I have done for the Venetian \t\t\tgovernment will count for more than his complaints will. No one \t\t\tknows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I \t\t\tcome from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman \t\t\tI’ve married. And let me tell you, Iago, if I \t\t\tdidn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d \t\t\tnever agree to get married and lose my freedom at all. But look at \t\t\tthose lights. Who’s coming?']
['IAGO', 'That’s her father and his friends, who’ve \t\t\tbeen roused out of bed. You’d better go inside.']
['OTHELLO', 'No, I must let them find me. My good qualities, my legal status as \t\t\tDesdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me. Is \t\t\tit them?']
['IAGO', 'I don’t think so.']
['OTHELLO', 'The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant? Hello, everyone! \t\t\tWhat’s going on?']
['CASSIO', 'The Duke sends his regards. He needs to see you right away.']
['OTHELLO', 'What do you think he wants?']
['CASSIO', 'Something about Cyprus. I think it’s important. The \t\t\twarships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, \t\t\tand many of the senators have been awakened and are at the \t\t\tDuke’s already. They’re very anxious for you \t\t\tto get there. When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent \t\t\tout three different search parties to find you.']
['OTHELLO', 'It’s good you found me. I’ll just speak a \t\t\tword or two here in the house and then I’ll go with \t\t    you.']
['CASSIO', 'Ensign, what’s he doing in there?']
['IAGO', 'Tonight he boarded a treasure ship. If he can keep it, \t\t\the’ll be set forever.']
['CASSIO', 'I don’t understand.']
['IAGO', 'He’s married.']
['CASSIO', 'To whom?']
['IAGO', 'To—']
['OTHELLO', 'Yes, I’ll go with you now.']
['CASSIO', 'Here comes another group looking for you.']
['IAGO', 'It’s Brabantio. Look out, sir. He intends to do \t\t\tsomething bad to you.']
['OTHELLO', 'Hey! Stop right there!']
['RODERIGO', 'Sir, it’s the Moor.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Get him, he’s a thief!']
['IAGO', 'You, Roderigo! Come on, I’ll fight you.']
['OTHELLO', 'Put away your swords. They’ll get rusty in the dew. \t\t\tSir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons \t\t    do.']
['BRABANTIO', 'You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter? You devil, \t\t\tyou’ve put a spell on her! Anybody with eyes could tell \t\t\tyou that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, who’s \t\t\trefused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city, \t\t\twouldn’t run off with a black thing like you unless \t\t\tshe’d been bewitched. You’re something to \t\t\tfear, not to love. It’s obvious to everyone that \t\t\tyou’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her. \t\t\tThat’s probably what happened, so I’m \t\t\tarresting you.—Arrest this man as a practitioner of black \t\t\tmagic. Grab him. If he struggles, use force!']
['OTHELLO', 'Just a minute. I don’t need anyone to tell me when to \t\t\tfight. You’ve accused me of some serious crimes. Where do \t\t\tyou want me to go to respond to these charges?']
['BRABANTIO', 'To prison, until you’re called into court.']
['OTHELLO', 'What if I do what you say? How would I satisfy the Duke then? His \t\t\tmessengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on \t\t\tpressing state business.']
['OFFICER', 'It’s true. The Duke’s in a meeting right \t\t\tnow, and he’s sent for you too.']
['BRABANTIO', 'The Duke’s in a meeting? At this time of night? Bring \t\t\thim with us. The law’s on my side. The Duke and any of my \t\t\tfellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were \t\t\ttheir own. If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens \t\t\twill be our rulers.']
['DUKE', 'These reports are inconsistent. You can’t trust \t\t    them.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'It’s true, they’re inconsistent. My letters \t\t\tsay there are a hundred and seven ships.']
['DUKE', 'And mine say a hundred and forty.']
['SECOND SENATOR', 'And mine say two hundred. But often in these cases, reports are \t\t\tjust estimates. The important thing is that they all say a Turkish \t\t\tfleet is approaching Cyprus.']
['DUKE', 'Yes, we get the idea. The inconsistency doesn’t make me \t\t\tthink that the reports are all wrong. I have no doubt about what \t\t\tthey’re basically saying, and it’s \t\t\tfrightening.']
['SAILOR', ' (offstage) Hello! Hey, \t\t    hello!']
['OFFICER', 'It’s a messenger from the warships.']
['DUKE', 'Why are you here?']
['SAILOR', 'Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkish \t\t\tfleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus.']
['DUKE', 'What do you think about this change?']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'They can’t have changed; there’s no way this \t\t\tcould be true. It’s a trick to confuse us. Think about \t\t\thow important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they could \t\t\tcapture Cyprus more easily, since it isn’t as well \t\t\tprotected as Rhodes is. If we keep these things in mind, we \t\t\tcan’t possibly imagine that the Turks would be so \t\t\tincompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first, \t\t\tsetting aside something easy and profitable to do something \t\t\tdangerous and pointless.']
['DUKE', 'No, I think we can be confident that the Turks aren’t \t\t\treally headed for Rhodes.']
['OFFICER', 'Here’s some more news coming in.']
['MESSENGER', 'Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with another \t\t\tfleet.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'That’s just what I thought. How many, can you \t\t    guess?']
['MESSENGER', 'Thirty ships. Now they’ve turned around and are clearly \t\t\theading for Cyprus. Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, \t\t\tgives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to \t\t\trelieve him.']
['DUKE', 'Then it’s certain they’re heading for \t\t\tCyprus. Is Marcus Luccicos in town?']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'No, he’s in Florence.']
['DUKE', 'Write to him immediately. Hurry.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.']
['DUKE', 'Brave Othello, I have to send you right away to fight the Turks, \t\t\tour great enemy.—(to \t\t\t    BRABANTIO) Oh, I \t\t\tdidn’t see you there. Welcome, sir. I could have used \t\t\tyour wisdom and help tonight.']
['BRABANTIO', 'I could have used yours as well. Forgive me, your grace. I \t\t\tdidn’t get out of bed and come here in the dead of night \t\t\tbecause I heard about the war or because I was worried about the \t\t\tcity’s defense. I have a personal problem so painful and \t\t\tgut-wrenching that it overwhelms everything else.']
['DUKE', 'Why, what’s the matter?']
['BRABANTIO', 'It’s my daughter! Oh, my daughter!']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'Is she dead?']
['BRABANTIO', 'She’s dead to me. She’s been tricked and \t\t\tstolen from me, enchanted by black magic spells. She \t\t\tmust’ve']
['DUKE', 'Whoever tricked your daughter and stole her from you will pay for \t\t\tit. And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and \t\t\timpose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were \t\t\tmy own son.']
['BRABANTIO', 'I humbly thank you, sir. Here is the man, the Moor. It seems you \t\t\thad your own reasons for summoning him here.']
['ALL', 'We’re sorry to hear this.']
['DUKE', ' (to OTHELLO) What do you have to say for yourself?']
['BRABANTIO', 'Nothing, but this is true.']
['OTHELLO', 'Noble, honorable gentlemen whom I serve: it’s true that \t\t\tI’ve taken this man’s daughter from him and \t\t\tmarried her. But that’s my only offense. \t\t\tThere’s nothing more. I’m awkward in my speech \t\t\tand I’m not a smooth talker. From the time I was seven \t\t\tyears old until nine months ago I’ve been fighting in \t\t\tbattles. I don’t know much about the world apart from \t\t\tfighting. So I won’t do myself much good by speaking in \t\t\tmy own defense. But if you’ll let me, I’ll \t\t\ttell you the plain']
['BRABANTIO', 'She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient. She blushes at \t\t\tthe slightest thing. And you want me to believe that despite her \t\t\tyoung age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man \t\t\tshe’d be afraid to look at? The very thought of it is \t\t\tridiculous. You’d have to be stupid to think that someone \t\t\tso perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that. The devil \t\t\tmust be behind this. Therefore I say again that he must have used \t\t\tsome powerful drug or magic potion on her.']
['DUKE', 'Your saying this isn’t proof. There has to be clear \t\t\tevidence that he’s done this, not just these \t\t    accusations.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'Tell us, Othello. Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way? \t\t\tOr did you agree to this as equals?']
['OTHELLO', 'Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn \t\t\tand ask her to speak about me in front']
['DUKE', 'Bring Desdemona here.']
['OTHELLO', 'Iago, bring Desdemona here. You know where she is.']
['DUKE', 'Tell us, Othello.']
['OTHELLO', 'Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, \t\t\tcontinually asking me about my life and all the battles \t\t\tI’ve fought. I told him everything, from my boyhood up \t\t\tuntil the time when I was talking to him. I told him about \t\t\tunfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land, \t\t\tand near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures I’ve been \t\t\tthrough. I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how I \t\t\tbought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts. I \t\t\twas able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other, and men \t\t\twith heads growing below their shoulders. When I talked about all \t\t\tthese things, Desdemona used to listen attentively. If she had to go \t\t\tdo some household chore, I noticed that she’d always come \t\t\tback quickly to hear more of my stories.']
['DUKE', 'I think a story like that would win my own daughter over. \t\t\tBrabantio, I urge you to make the best of this. Try to accept \t\t\twhat’s happened.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Please let her speak. If she admits she wanted this, then I \t\t\twon’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child. Who \t\t\tdo you obey here?']
['DESDEMONA', 'Father, this isn’t easy for me. I’m torn. I \t\t\towe you respect because you gave me life and education. \t\t\tYou’re the one I have to obey. I’m your \t\t\tdaughter. But this man here is my husband now, and I owe him as much \t\t\tas my mother owed you, just as she preferred you to her own father. \t\t\tSo I have to give my obedience to the Moor, my husband.']
['BRABANTIO', 'I’m finished, then. Duke, please go ahead with your \t\t\tstate business. I’d rather adopt a child than have one of \t\t\tmy own.—Come here, Moor. I’m forced to give my \t\t\tblessing to this marriage. With all my heart, I give you that thing \t\t\twhich, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try \t\t\twith all my heart to keep from you. Desdemona, I’m glad \t\t\tyou’re my only child, since if I had others \t\t\tI’d keep them all locked up. You would have made me treat \t\t\tthem like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.']
['DUKE', 'Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: \t\t\tif you can’t change something, don’t cry about \t\t\tit. When you lament something bad that’s already \t\t\thappened, you’re setting yourself up for more']
['BRABANTIO', 'So if the Turks steal Cyprus from us, it won’t be bad \t\t\tas long as we keep smiling. It’s easy to accept \t\t\tplatitudes like that if you haven’t lost anything. But \t\t\tI’ve lost something precious, and I have to put up with \t\t\tthe platitude as well as suffering my loss. Talk is cheap. \t\t\tI’ve never heard of someone feeling better because of \t\t\tsomeone else’s words. Please, I’m asking you, \t\t\tgo ahead and get back to your state affairs.']
['DUKE', 'The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet. Othello, \t\t\tyou understand better than anyone how the defenses for Cyprus work. \t\t\tEven though we have a very good officer in charge there already, \t\t\teveryone says you’re the better man for the job. So \t\t\tI’ll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriage \t\t\tcelebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition.']
['OTHELLO', 'I’ve gotten used to the hardships of a military life. I \t\t\trise to the occasion when faced with difficulties. I will take \t\t\tcharge of this war against the Turks. But I humbly ask you to make \t\t\tappropriate arrangements for my wife,']
['DUKE', 'She can stay at her father’s house.']
['BRABANTIO', 'I won’t allow it.']
['OTHELLO', 'Neither will I.']
['DESDEMONA', 'And I wouldn’t stay there. I don’t want to \t\t\tupset my father by being in his house. Dear Duke, please listen to \t\t\twhat I have to say.']
['DUKE', 'What do you want to do, Desdemona?']
['DESDEMONA', 'When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted \t\t\tto live with him. You can see how much I wanted to be with him by \t\t\thow violently I threw away my old life. I feel like I’m a \t\t\tpart of him now, and that means I’m part of a soldier. I \t\t\tsaw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind. I gave my \t\t\twhole life to him because of his honor and bravery. If I were left \t\t\tat home uselessly while he went off to war, then I’m \t\t\tseparated from my husband in his natural element. I’d be \t\t\tmiserable without him. Let me go with him.']
['OTHELLO', 'Please allow her to do this. I’m not asking to have her \t\t\tnear me for sex—I’m too old for that, and my \t\t\tsexual']
['DUKE', 'You can decide that privately. I don’t care whether she \t\t\tstays or goes. What’s important is the urgency of this \t\t\tmission. You’ve got to act fast.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'You’ll have to leave tonight.']
['OTHELLO', 'With all my heart, I’ll go right away.']
['DUKE', 'We’ll meet again at nine in the morning. Othello, have \t\t\tone of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and \t\t\twhatever else is important to you.']
['OTHELLO', 'My lord, my ensign is an honest and trustworthy man. \t\t\tHe’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you \t\t\tthink I might need.']
['DUKE', 'All right, then. Good night, everyone.—(to BRABANTIO) Sir, if goodness is beautiful, your son-in-law is \t\t\tbeautiful, not black.']
['FIRST SENATOR', 'Goodbye, black Moor. Treat Desdemona well.']
['BRABANTIO', 'Keep an eye on her, Moor. She lied to me, and she may lie to \t\t    you.']
['OTHELLO', 'I’d bet my life she’d never lie to me. Iago, \t\t\tI’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you. Have your wife \t\t\tattend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can. Come on, \t\t\tDesdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with \t\t\tyou, to tell you what you need to do. We’re on a tight \t\t\tschedule.']
['RODERIGO', 'Iago.']
['IAGO', 'What do you have to say, noble friend?']
['RODERIGO', 'What do you think I should do?']
['IAGO', 'Go to bed, and sleep.']
['RODERIGO', 'I’m going to go drown myself.']
['IAGO', 'If you do that, I’ll never respect you again. Why, you \t\t\tsilly man!']
['RODERIGO', 'It’s silly to live when life is torture. The only cure \t\t\tis death.']
['IAGO', 'Oh, how stupid! I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, \t\t\tand I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him. \t\t\tI’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for \t\t\tsome woman I can’t have.']
['RODERIGO', 'What should I do? I know it’s foolish to be so much in \t\t\tlove, but I can’t help it.']
['IAGO', 'Can’t help it? Nonsense! What we are is up to us. Our \t\t\tbodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener. \t\t\tDepending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind \t\t\tof herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and \t\t\tuseless, or rich and productive. If we didn’t have \t\t\trational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our \t\t\tbodily urges would take over. We’d end up in ridiculous \t\t\tsituations. Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts. In \t\t\tmy opinion, what you call love is just an offshoot of lust.']
['RODERIGO', 'I don’t believe it.']
['IAGO', 'You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower. \t\t\tCome on, be a man. Drown yourself? Drowning is for cats or blind \t\t\tpuppies—don’t drown yourself! I’ve \t\t\ttold you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick \t\t\tby you. ']
['RODERIGO', 'Can I count on you if I wait to see what happens?']
['IAGO', 'You can trust me. Go now and get cash. I told you before, and \t\t\tI’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor. \t\t\tI’m devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted as \t\t\tyou are to yours. So let’s join forces and get revenge. \t\t\tIf you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, it’ll \t\t\tbe fun for both of us. Many things may happen. Go get money. \t\t\tWe’ll speak again tomorrow. Goodbye.']
['RODERIGO', 'Where will we meet in the morning?']
['IAGO', 'At my house.']
['RODERIGO', 'I’ll be there early.']
['IAGO', 'Go home. Goodbye. Oh, and one more thing—']
['RODERIGO', 'What is it?']
['IAGO', 'No more talk about killing yourself, okay?']
['RODERIGO', 'I’ve changed my mind about that.']
['IAGO', 'Go then, goodbye. Put a lot of cash together.']
['RODERIGO', 'I’m going to sell all my land.']
['IAGO', 'That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools. \t\t\tI’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that \t\t\tif I couldn’t get something useful out of him. I hate the \t\t\tMoor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s \t\t\tslept with my wife. I’m not sure it’s true, \t\t\tbut just the suspicion is enough for me. He thinks highly of me. \t\t\tThat’ll help. Cassio’s a handsome man. \t\t\tLet’s see, how can I']
['MONTANO', 'What can you see out on the ocean?']
['FIRST GENTLEMAN', 'Nothing. The water’s so rough that I can’t \t\t\tsee any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean.']
['MONTANO', 'It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook our \t\t\tfortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together in \t\t\tthose mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result of \t\t\tthis storm?']
['SECOND GENTLEMAN', 'The Turkish navy will be broken up. The wind’s whipping \t\t\tup the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash \t\t\tagainst the stars in the sky. I’ve never seen the waters \t\t\tso disturbed.']
['MONTANO', 'If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, \t\t\ttheir men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this \t\t    storm.']
['THIRD GENTLEMAN', 'I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over! This \t\t\tterrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are \t\t\truined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their \t\t\tfleet shipwrecked.']
['MONTANO', 'What? Is this true?']
['THIRD GENTLEMAN', 'The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s \t\t\tfrom Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has \t\t\tarrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. He’s \t\t\tbeen commissioned to come here to Cyprus.']
['MONTANO', 'I’m happy about that. He’ll be a good \t\t\tgovernor.']
['THIRD GENTLEMAN', 'Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but \t\t\the’s worried about the Othello’s safety. The \t\t\ttwo of them were separated during the storm.']
['MONTANO', 'I hope to God Othello’s all right. I served under him, \t\t\tand I know what an excellent commander he is. Let’s go to \t\t\tthe shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out \t\t\tfor Othello’s ship. We’ll stare out at the sea \t\t\tuntil the sea and the sky blur together.']
['THIRD GENTLEMAN', 'Let’s do that. Every minute we expect more ships to \t\t\tarrive.']
['CASSIO', 'Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello. \t\t\tI hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of \t\t\thim on the stormy sea.']
['MONTANO', 'Is his ship sturdy?']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot \t\t\tis very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have some \t\t\thope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too \t\t\thigh.']
['A VOICE', ' (offstage) A sail! A sail! A \t\t    sail!']
['CASSIO', 'What’s all that shouting about?']
['MESSENGER', 'Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A \t\t\tsail!”']
['CASSIO', 'I hope it’s Othello.']
['SECOND GENTLEMAN', 'They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least \t\t\tit’s a friendly ship.']
['CASSIO', 'Please go find out for certain who has arrived.']
['SECOND GENTLEMAN', 'I’ll do that.']
['MONTANO', 'Good lieutenant, is your general married?']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he \t\t\tdid. His wife defies description. She’s God’s \t\t\tmasterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her \t\t\tjustice while praising her.']
['SECOND GENTLEMAN', 'A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.']
['CASSIO', 'He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and \t\t\tthe sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman. \t\t\tThey let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound.']
['MONTANO', 'Who’s that?']
['CASSIO', 'She’s the one I was talking about, the \t\t\tgeneral’s wife. The brave Iago was put in charge of \t\t\tbringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we \t\t\texpected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here \t\t\tsafely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms, \t\t\tand Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Thank you, brave Cassio. Is there any news about my \t\t    husband?']
['CASSIO', 'He hasn’t arrived yet. As far as I know, \t\t\the’s okay and will arrive here soon.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Oh, but I’m worried. How did you two get \t\t    separated?']
['CASSIO', 'The storm separated us.']
['A VOICE', ' (offstage) A sail! A sail!']
['CASSIO', 'Listen, they’ve spotted another ship!']
['SECOND GENTLEMAN', 'They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly \t\t    ship.']
['CASSIO', 'Go find out the news.']
['IAGO', 'If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be \t\t\tsick of her by now.']
['DESDEMONA', 'On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman.']
['IAGO', 'No, she talks too much. She’s always talking when I \t\t\twant to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a \t\t\tbit quiet. But she’s scolding me silently.']
['EMILIA', 'You have no reason to say that.']
['IAGO', 'Come on, come on. You women are all the same. You’re as \t\t\tpretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your \t\t\town houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells. In your own \t\t\tkitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound like \t\t\tsaints when you’re complaining about something, but you \t\t\tact like devils when someone offends you. You don’t take \t\t\tyour jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless \t\t\thussies in bed.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Shame on you, you slanderer!']
['IAGO', 'No, it’s true, or if it’s not, \t\t\tI’m a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you start \t\t\twork when you go to bed.']
['EMILIA', 'You clearly have nothing good to say about me.']
['IAGO', 'No, I don’t.']
['DESDEMONA', 'But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you \t\t    say?']
['IAGO', 'Don’t make me do it, my lady. I’m critical \t\t\tby nature.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to \t\t\tthe harbor?']
['IAGO', 'Yes, madam.']
['DESDEMONA', 'I’m not as happy as I seem. I’m just trying \t\t\tnot to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety. Come \t\t\ton, what would you say about me?']
['IAGO', 'I’m trying to think of something, but I’m \t\t\tnot good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah, \t\t\tI’ve got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her \t\t\tgood looks to get what she wants.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly?']
['IAGO', 'Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough \t\t\tto find a guy to sleep with her.']
['DESDEMONA', 'This is getting worse and worse!']
['EMILIA', 'What if she’s pretty but stupid?']
['IAGO', 'No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her \t\t\tmore attractive to men.']
['DESDEMONA', 'These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. What \t\t\thorrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s \t\t\tboth ugly and stupid?']
['IAGO', 'No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same \t\t\tdirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do.']
['DESDEMONA', 'You don’t know a thing! You give your best praise to \t\t\tthe worst women. But how would you praise a truly good woman, \t\t\tsomeone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about \t\t    her?']
['IAGO', 'A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well \t\t\tbut knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never \t\t\toverdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she \t\t\twanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when \t\t\tpeople hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could \t\t\tthink without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from \t\t\tflirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever \t\t\texisted, would—']
['DESDEMONA', 'Would do what?']
['IAGO', 'Would raise babies and clip coupons.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Oh, that’s pathetic! Don’t listen to him, \t\t\tEmilia, even though he’s your husband. What do you think \t\t\tabout him, Cassio? Isn’t he a horrible man?']
['CASSIO', 'He speaks bluntly, madam. He’s more of a soldier than a \t\t\twise man.']
['IAGO', ' (to himself) He’s taking \t\t\ther hand. That’s right, go ahead and whisper together. \t\t\tThis is all I need to get Cassio. Yes, keep smiling at her, Cassio. Your fine manners around \t\t\twomen will be your downfall. Oh, I’m sure \t\t\tyou’re saying something very clever. ']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, it is.']
['DESDEMONA', 'Let’s go greet him when he lands.']
['CASSIO', 'Look, here he comes.']
['OTHELLO', 'My beautiful warrior!']
['DESDEMONA', 'My darling Othello!']
['OTHELLO', 'I’m amazed you got here before me. But I’m \t\t\toverjoyed! My love, if the calm after the storm could always be this \t\t\twonderful, I’d want the wind to blow until it waked the \t\t\tdead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains! If I died right now \t\t\tI’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably \t\t\tnever be as happy as this again in my life.']
['DESDEMONA', 'God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we \t\t\tget older.']
['OTHELLO', 'Amen to that! I can’t talk about my happiness anymore. \t\t\tIt’s too much. I hope these kisses I’m about \t\t\tto give you are the closest we ever come to fighting.(they kiss) ']
['IAGO', ' (to himself) Oh, you’re \t\t\thappy now, but I’ll ruin your happiness, for all my \t\t\tsupposed honesty.']
['OTHELLO', 'Let’s go up to the castle. Good news, friends. The \t\t\twar’s over and the Turks are drowned. How are my old \t\t\tfriends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll \t\t\tlove you here in Cyprus. They’ve been very good to me \t\t\there. Oh, my dear, I’m blabbing on and on because \t\t\tI’m so happy.—Iago, would you be good enough \t\t\tto go get my trunks from the ships? And bring the ship’s \t\t\tcaptain to the castle. He’s a good \t\t\tman.—Let’s go, Desdemona. I’ll say \t\t\tit again: I’m so happy to see you here in Cyprus!']
['IAGO', 'Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here. They say love \t\t\tmakes cowards brave. So if you’re brave, listen to me. \t\t\tLieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight. But first, I have \t\t\tto tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with \t\t    him.']
['RODERIGO', 'With Cassio? That’s impossible.']
['IAGO', 'Be quiet and listen to me. Remember how she fell madly in love \t\t\twith the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories? Did \t\t\tyou expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering? \t\t\tYou’re too smart to think that. No, she needs someone \t\t\tnice-looking. Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she \t\t\tfind in him? Lovemaking gets boring after a while. To keep things \t\t\thot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, \t\t\tsomeone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her. \t\t\tOthello isn’t any of those things. Since he \t\t\tdoesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to \t\t\ther, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to \t\t\tpuke. She’ll start looking around for a second choice. \t\t\tNow, if that’s true—and it’s \t\t\tobviously true—who’s in a better position than \t\t\tCassio? He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and \t\t\tfine manners to hide his lust. Nobody’s as crafty as he \t\t\tis. Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s \t\t\tgot all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for. \t\t\tHe’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on \t\t\thim already.']
['RODERIGO', 'I can’t believe that. She’s not that kind of \t\t\twoman. She’s very moral.']
['IAGO', 'Like hell she is! She’s made of the same flesh and \t\t\tblood as everyone else. If she were so moral, she would never have \t\t\tfallen in love with the Moor in the first place. Good lord! Did you \t\t\tnotice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s \t\t\thands? Did you see that?']
['RODERIGO', 'Yes, I did. But that wasn’t romantic, it was just \t\t\tpolite manners.']
['IAGO', 'They were lusting after each other. You could tell by how they \t\t\twere acting that they’re going to be lovers. They were so \t\t\tclose that their breath was mingling. When two people get that \t\t\tintimate, sex will soon follow. Disgusting! But listen to me; let me \t\t\tguide you. I brought you here from Venice. Be on guard duty tonight. \t\t\tI’ll put you in charge. Cassio doesn’t know \t\t\tyou. I’ll be nearby. Make Cassio angry somehow, either by \t\t\tspeaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else \t\t\tyou want.']
['RODERIGO', 'All right.']
['IAGO', 'He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his \t\t\tstaff. Try to get him to do that. That’ll allow me to \t\t\tstir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus. I’ll \t\t\tget them so riled up that they’ll only calm down when \t\t\tCassio’s fired. To get what you want, you need to get \t\t\tCassio out of the way. If you don’t do that, things are \t\t\thopeless for you.']
['RODERIGO', 'I’ll do it, if you help me out.']
['IAGO', 'I promise I will. Meet me in a little while at the citadel. I need \t\t\tto get Othello’s things from the ship. Goodbye.']
['RODERIGO', 'Goodbye.']
['IAGO', 'I think Cassio really does love her, and it’s perfectly \t\t\tlikely that she loves him too. I can’t stand the Moor, \t\t\tbut I have to admit that he’s a reliable, loving, and \t\t\tgood-natured man. He’d probably be a good husband to \t\t\tDesdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed \t\t\tmy revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. That \t\t\tthought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I won’t \t\t\tbe satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If I \t\t\tcan’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous \t\t\tthat he can’t think straight. If that piece of Venetian \t\t\ttrash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan, \t\t\tI’ll have power over Cassio. I’ll say bad \t\t\tthings about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced my \t\t\twife as well. I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and \t\t\treward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time. \t\t\tI’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked \t\t\tout the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan until \t\t\tthe moment comes.']
['HERALD', "Our noble and courageous general Othello having been informed that \t\t\tthe Turkish fleet has been completely destroyed, invites every man \t\t\tto celebrate our victory. Some of you dance, some of you make \t\t\tbonfires, and every man celebrate in whatever way he likes to. For \t\t\tbesides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage. \t\t\tThat’s the end of the announcement. There will be a feast \t\t\tfrom five o'clock until eleven. God bless the island of \t\t\tCyprus and our noble general Othello!"]
['OTHELLO', 'Good Michael, keep a careful eye on the guards tonight. \t\t\tLet’s exercise restraint and not let the party get too \t\t\twild.']
['CASSIO', 'Iago has orders what to do. But I’ll see to it \t\t\tpersonally anyway.']
['OTHELLO', 'Iago’s a good man. Goodnight, Michael. Come talk to me \t\t\ttomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love. \t\t\tNow that the wedding’s over, we can have the pleasure of \t\t\tconsummating our marriage. Good night, everyone.']
['CASSIO', 'Hello, Iago. It’s time for us to stand guard.']
['IAGO', "Not yet, lieutenant. It’s not even ten \t\t\to'clock. The general got rid of us early tonight so he \t\t\tcould be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him. He \t\t\thasn’t spent the night with her yet, and she’s \t\t\tbeautiful enough to be Jove’sJove is the head of the gods in Roman mythology.Jove’s lover."]
['CASSIO', 'She’s an exquisitely beautiful lady.']
['IAGO', 'And I bet she’s good in bed too.']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, she’s young and tender.']
['IAGO', 'And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation.']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, she’s pretty. But she’s modest and \t\t\tladylike too.']
['IAGO', 'And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up \t\t    passion?']
['CASSIO', 'She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.']
['IAGO', 'Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant. \t\t\tI’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen \t\t\twant to drink a toast to the black Othello.']
['CASSIO', 'Not tonight, Iago. I’m not much of a drinker. I wish \t\t\tthere was less social pressure to drink.']
['IAGO', 'Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. I’ll do \t\t\tmost of the drinking for you.']
['CASSIO', 'I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, \t\t\tbut look how drunk I am. I’m not a heavy drinker. I \t\t\twouldn’t dare drink much more than that.']
['IAGO', 'What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! The \t\t\tgentlemen are waiting.']
['CASSIO', 'Where are they?']
['IAGO', 'By the door. Please invite them in.']
['CASSIO', 'I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.']
['IAGO', 'If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what \t\t\the’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative \t\t\tand eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twisted \t\t\tup inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the \t\t\tgallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the \t\t\trest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus \t\t\twho are quick to take offense. Now I’ll get Cassio to do \t\t\tsomething in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone \t\t\ton the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope it \t\t\twill, I’m all set for success.']
['CASSIO', 'My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.']
['MONTANO', 'No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.']
['IAGO', 'Bring in more wine!']
['CASSIO', 'My God, what a great song!']
['IAGO', 'I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking. The \t\t\tDanes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, \t\t\tdrink!—are nothing compared to the English.']
['CASSIO', 'Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?']
['IAGO', 'They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at \t\t\tall to out-drink Germans. And the Dutch are vomiting while the \t\t\tEnglish are asking for refills.']
['CASSIO', 'Let’s drink to our general!']
['MONTANO', 'Hear, hear! I’ll drink as much as you do!']
['IAGO', 'Oh, sweet England!']
['CASSIO', 'God, that song’s even better than the other one.']
['IAGO', 'Do you want to hear it again?']
['CASSIO', 'No, because we shouldn’t be doing \t\t\tthat—stuff. Oh well, God’s in charge, and some \t\t\tpeople have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to \t\t    hell.']
['IAGO', 'That’s true, lieutenant.']
['CASSIO', 'Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or \t\t\tanyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.']
['IAGO', 'Me too, lieutenant.']
['CASSIO', 'Okay, but please not before me. The lieutenant has to get to \t\t\theaven before the ensign. But let’s stop this drinking \t\t\tand get down to business.—God forgive our \t\t\tsins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business. \t\t\tBy the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m \t\t\tdrunk. This is my ensign. This is my right hand, and this is my left \t\t\thand.']
['ALL', 'Yes, you’re speaking very well.']
['CASSIO', 'Yes, very well. So don’t think that I’m \t\t\tdrunk.']
['MONTANO', 'Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand \t\t\tguard. Come on.']
['IAGO', 'You see that man who just left? He’s a good soldier, \t\t\tgood enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man. But he has a \t\t\tserious weakness. It’s too bad. I’m worried \t\t\tthat Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for \t\t\tCyprus eventually.']
['MONTANO', 'But is he often like this?']
['IAGO', 'He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep. \t\t\tHe’d stay up all night and all day if he \t\t\tdidn’t drink himself to sleep.']
['MONTANO', 'The general should be informed about this. Maybe he’s \t\t\tnever noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good \t\t\tside. Don’t you think so?']
['IAGO', ' (speaking so that only RODERIGO \t\t\t    can hear) Hello, Roderigo. \t\t\tPlease, follow the lieutenant. Hurry! Go!']
['MONTANO', 'And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a \t\t\tdeep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We should \t\t\tdefinitely say something to the Moor.']
['IAGO', 'I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole \t\t\tisland for doing so. I respect Cassio and I’d like to \t\t\thelp cure his alcoholism—']
['IAGO', 'What’s that noise?']
['CASSIO', 'Damn you, you villain, you rascal!']
['MONTANO', 'What’s the matter, lieutenant?']
['CASSIO', 'To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners! \t\t\tI’ll beat him until the welts look like \t\t    basket-weave!']
['RODERIGO', 'You’ll beat me?']
['CASSIO', 'Are you talking, you villain?(he \t\t\thits RODERIGO) ']
['MONTANO', 'No, don’t hit him, lieutenant! Please, sir, restrain \t\t\tyourself. (he restrains CASSIO) ']
['CASSIO', 'Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.']
['MONTANO', 'Come on, you’re drunk.']
['CASSIO', 'Drunk?']
['IAGO', ' (speaking so that only RODERIGO \t\t\t    can hear) Go tell everyone \t\t\tthere’s a riot.—']
['OTHELLO', 'What is the matter here?']
['MONTANO', 'My God, I’m bleeding! I’ve been mortally \t\t\twounded. I’ll kill him!']
['OTHELLO', 'Stop right now!']
['IAGO', 'Stop! Lieutenant—sir, Montano—gentlemen! \t\t\tHave you forgotten your duty and your sense of decorum? Stop! The \t\t\tgeneral is talking to you! Stop, for God’s sake!']

['MONTANO', 'I know you’re close to Cassio, but if you diverge from \t\t\tthe truth in any way, you’re not a true soldier.']
['IAGO', 'You’re hitting close to home there. I’d \t\t\trather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about \t\t\tMichael Cassio. But I don’t think it’ll hurt \t\t\thim to tell the truth. This is what happened, General. Montano and I \t\t\twere talking when a man came running, crying for help. Cassio was \t\t\tchasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy. This \t\t\tgentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. I \t\t\tfollowed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring \t\t\tthe public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heard \t\t\tthe swords clinking and Cassio swearing. I’d never heard \t\t\thim swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you saw \t\t\twhen you pulled them apart. I can’t tell you anything \t\t\telse.']

There are lots \t\t\tof ways to get on the general’s good side again. \t\t\tYou’ve been discharged because he’s angry, and \t\t\tbecause he’s obliged to do so for policy reasons, not \t\t\tbecause he dislikes you. He’s got to beat up the weak to \t\t\tfrighten the strong. Go to him, petition him. He’ll \t\t\tchange his mind.']
['CASSIO', 'I’d rather ask him to hate me than ask such a good \t\t\tcommander to accept such a worthless, drunk, stupid officer as \t\t\tmyself. Drunk? Babbling senselessly? Squabbling? Swaggering? \t\t\tSwearing? Ranting and raving to my own shadow! Oh, wine is the \t\t\tdevil!']
['IAGO', 'Who were you chasing with your sword? What did he do to \t\t    you?']
['CASSIO', 'I don’t know.']
['IAGO', 'Is that possible?']
['CASSIO', 'I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly. I \t\t\tremember a fight, but not why we were fighting. Oh God, why do men \t\t\tdrink and lose their minds? Why do we party until we’re \t\t\tlike animals?']
['IAGO', 'You seem all right now. How did you get better?']

['CASSIO', 'I’ll ask him for my position back again, and \t\t\the’ll tell me I’m a drunk.

Ask her to help you get back your position. She is so generous, \t\t\tkind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to \t\t\tdo everything she can, even more than she is asked to do. Ask her to \t\t\thelp you heal the rift between her husband and you. I’d \t\t\tbet my lucky stars your problem will be forgotten, and your \t\t\trelationship will be stronger than ever.']

That’s the kind of argument you’d expect \t\t\tfrom Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they \t\t\tput on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing \t\t\tnow. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while \t\t\tshe’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll \t\t\tpoison the Moor’s ear against her, hinting that \t\t\tshe’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust \t\t\tfor him.

You’re thinking something. Just                                 a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when                                 Cassio left my wife. What didn’t you like? And when I                                 told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get                                 Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And                                 then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were                                 imagining something horrible.

If some                                 lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick.

I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and                                 I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache. Well,                                 some people talk in their sleep, and Cassio is one of them.

Get out of my                                 heart, love! My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous                                 snakes!']

['DESDEMONA', 'I’m sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time                                 to bring up your case. My husband’s not himself. If his                                 face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t                                 recognize him. God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and                                 made him angry at me for being so aggressive. You’ll just                                 have to be patient for a little while. I’ll do what I                                 can, more than I’d do for myself.

['IAGO', 'Is Othello angry?']
['EMILIA', 'He just left, clearly upset about something.']
['IAGO', 'Can he even get angry? It’s hard to believe.                                 I’ve seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his                                 soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting                                 an eyelid—is he really upset? It must be about something                                 important. I’ll go talk to him. If he’s angry,                                 there must be something seriously wrong.']

['CASSIO', 'Oh, come on, woman. Stop jumping to silly conclusions. Now                                 you’re jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress                                 of mine, but I swear it’s not, Bianca.']
['BIANCA', 'Well, whose is it?']
['CASSIO', 'I don’t even know. I found it in my room.                                 It’s pretty. Someone is certainly looking for it, and                                 I’ll have to give it back. So I’d like it                                 copied. Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a                             while.']
['BIANCA', 'Leave you alone! Why?']
['CASSIO', 'I’m waiting here for the general, and I                                 don’t want him to see me with a woman.']
['BIANCA', 'And why’s that?']
['CASSIO', 'It’s not because I don’t love you.']
['BIANCA', 'But you don’t love me. Please, just walk with me a                                 little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later                             tonight.']
['CASSIO', 'I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m                                 waiting here. But I’ll see you soon.']
['BIANCA', 'All right, have it your way. I have to make do.']
['IAGO', 'Do you really think so?']
['OTHELLO', 'What do you mean, do I think so?']
['IAGO', 'What, just because they kissed in private?']
['OTHELLO', 'An illicit kiss!']
['IAGO', 'Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but                                 they didn’t do anything.']
['OTHELLO', 'Naked in bed together, but without doing anything? Come on, Iago.                                 That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d                                 make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then                                 back off. Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil                                 tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them.']
['IAGO', 'As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a                                 minor sin. But if I gave my wife a handkerchief—']
['OTHELLO', 'Then what?']
['IAGO', 'Then it’s hers. And if it’s hers, I guess                                 she can give it to any man she wants.']
['OTHELLO', 'Her reputation is also her own. Can she give that away too?']
['IAGO', 'You can’t see a reputation. A lot of people                                 don’t even deserve the reputations they have. But a                                 handkerchief—']
['OTHELLO', 'God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told                                 me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my                                 handkerchief!']

['IAGO', 'What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or                                 heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there                                 who have to brag about bedding some woman.—']
['OTHELLO', 'Has he said anything?']
['IAGO', 'Yes, but he’d deny it all.']

I’ll kill him first, and then let him                                 confess—I’m trembling with rage.

At least                                 you’re not ignorant. The worst thing of all is to kiss                                 your wife thinking she’s innocent, when in fact                                 she’s a whore. No, I’d rather know the truth.                                 Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I                                 am.']

Come along with me.                                 I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that                                 you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.

There should be a huge eclipse of the                                 sun and the moon, now that Desdemona’s no longer on this                                 earth.']

['EMILIA', 'My God, who knows?']
['OTHELLO', 'You heard her say it wasn’t me.']
['EMILIA', 'Yes, she said that. I must go report what happened.']
['OTHELLO', 'She was lying even as she was going down to hell. I did kill                             her.']

['OTHELLO', 'She cheated on me, and she was a whore.']
['EMILIA', 'You slander her, you devil.']
['OTHELLO', 'She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.']

['EMILIA', 'My husband!']
['OTHELLO', 'Your husband.']

['OTHELLO', 'Yes, with Cassio. If she’d been faithful to me, I never                                 would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel                                 as big as a planet in exchange for her.']
['EMILIA', 'My husband.']
['OTHELLO', 'Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.                                 He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.']

['OTHELLO', 'Ha!']
['EMILIA', 'Go ahead, do your worst. Killing me won’t send you to                                 heaven. You weren’t good enough for her.']

['EMILIA', ' (to IAGO) Tell this villain he’s wrong, if                                 you’re man enough. He says you told him his wife cheated                                 on him. I know you didn’t. You’re not that                                 much of a villain. Speak, because I’m too emotional to                                 say any more.']
['IAGO', 'I told him what I thought. I didn’t tell him anything                                 that didn’t make sense or ring true to him.']
['EMILIA', 'But did you tell him she cheated on him?']
['IAGO', 'I did.']
['EMILIA', 'Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie. I swear on my soul it was                                 a lie. You said she slept with Cassio. Did you say Cassio?']
['IAGO', 'Yes, with Cassio. Now be quiet.']

['GRATIANO', 'Poor Desdemona! I’m glad your father isn’t                                 alive to see this. Your marriage made him die of grief before his                                 time. If he was alive now, this sight would hurt']
['OTHELLO', 'It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a                                 thousand times. Cassio confessed it, and she pledged her love to him                                 by giving him the handkerchief I’d given her. I saw it in                                 his hand.']

['EMILIA', 'Oh, you stupid Moor! I found that handkerchief by accident and                                 gave it to my husband. He’d begged me to steal it many                                 times.']
