['MACBETH', 'Until then, we’ve said enough. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Let’s go, my friends.']
['DUNCAN', 'Has the former thane of Cawdor been executed yet? Haven’t                                 the people in charge of that come back?']
['MALCOLM', 'My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke with                                 someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed                                 his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and                                 repented deeply. He never did anything in his whole life that looked                                 as good as the way he died. He died like someone who had practiced                                 how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a                                 worthless a piece of garbage.']
['DUNCAN', 'There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking                                 at his face. I trusted Cawdor completely.']
['MACBETH', 'The opportunity to serve you is its own reward. Your only duty,                                 your highness, is to accept what we owe you. Our duty to you and                                 your state is like the duty of children to their father or servants                                 to their master. By doing everything we can to protect you,                                 we’re only doing what we should.']
['DUNCAN', 'You are welcome here. By making you thane of Cawdor, I have                                 planted the seeds of a great career for you, and I will make sure                                 they grow. (to BANQUO) Noble Banquo, you deserve no less than                                 Macbeth, and everyone should know it. Let me bring you close to me                                 and give you the benefit of my love and good will.']
['BANQUO', 'Then if I accomplish anything great, it will be a credit to                             you.']
['DUNCAN', 'My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my eyes. My sons,                                 relatives, lords, and all those closest to me, I want you to witness                                 that I will bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm. Today I                                 name him the prince of Cumberland. But Malcolm isn’t going                                 to be alone in receiving honors—titles of nobility will                                 shine like stars on all of you who deserve them. (to MACBETH) And now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness,                                 where I will become even more obliged to you because of your                                 hospitality.']
['MACBETH', 'I’m not happy unless I can be working for you. I will go                                 ahead and bring my wife the good news that you are coming. With                                 that, I’ll be off.']
['DUNCAN', 'My worthy Cawdor!']
['MACBETH', ' (to himself) Malcolm is now the                                 prince of Cumberland! To become king myself, I’m either                                 going to have to step over him or give up, because he’s in                                 my way. Stars, hide your light so no one can see the terrible                                 desires within me. I won’t let my eye look at what my hand                                 is doing, but in the end I’m still going to do that thing                                 I’d be horrified to see.']
['DUNCAN', ' (to BANQUO,                                     in the middle of a conversation we haven’t                                 heard) You’re right, Banquo. Macbeth is every bit                                 as valiant as you say, and I am satisfied with these praises of him.                                 Let’s follow after him, now that he has gone ahead to                                 prepare our welcome. He is a man without equal.']
['LADY MACBETH', "“The witches met me on the day of my victory in                                 battle, and I have since learned that they have supernatural                                 knowledge. When I tried desperately to question them further, they                                 vanished into thin air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from                                 the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is                                 precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me                                 ’the future king!' I thought I should tell you                                 this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could                                 rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us.

['SERVANT', 'I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is                                 coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of                                 breath that he could barely speak his message.']
['LADY MACBETH', 'Take good care of him. He brings great news.']

Greet                                 the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and                                 your words. You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the                                 snake that hides underneath the flower.

['DUNCAN', 'This castle is in a pleasant place. The air is sweet and appeals                                 to my refined senses.']
['BANQUO', 'The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests                                 here proves how inviting the breezes are. There isn’t a                                 single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds                                 haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed.                                 I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where                                 the air is the nicest.']
['DUNCAN', 'Look, here comes our honored hostess! Sometimes the love my                                 subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love. In                                 doing so, I’m teaching you to thank me for the incovenience                                 I’m causing you by being here, because it comes from my                                 love to you.']
['LADY MACBETH', 'Everything we’re doing for you, even if it were doubled                                 and then doubled again, is nothing compared to the honors you have                                 brought to our family. We gladly welcome you as our guests, with                                 gratitude for both the honors you’ve given us before and                                 the new honors you’ve just given us.']

And                                 his great love, which is as sharp as his spur, helped him beat us                                 here. Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.']
['LADY MACBETH', 'We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and                                 everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in                                 your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s                                 yours.']

['MACBETH', 'If this business would really be finished when I did the deed,                                 then it would be best to get it over with quickly. If the                                 assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up                                 everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be                                 the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put                                 my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like                                 these there are still punishments in this world. By committing                                 violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and                                 the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers.                                 Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the                                 poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king trusts me in two                                 ways. First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should                                 always try to protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be                                 closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to                                 murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so                                 free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when                                 he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of                                 his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind                                 with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread                                 news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere. People will shed a                                 flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of                                 rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing                                 motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of                                 themselves toward disaster.']

['MACBETH', 'Has he asked for me?']
['LADY MACBETH', 'Don’t you know he has?']
['MACBETH', 'We can’t go on with this plan. The king has just honored                                 me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people. I                                 want to enjoy these honors while the feeling is fresh and not throw                                 them away so soon.']
['LADY MACBETH', 'Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before? Have you gone to                                 sleep and woken up green and pale in fear of this idea? From now on                                 this is what I’ll think of your love. Are you afraid to act                                 the way you desire? Will you take the crown you want so badly, or                                 will you live as a coward, always saying “I                                 can’t” after you say “I want                                 to”?

['MACBETH', 'Please, stop! I dare to do only what is proper for a man to do. He                                 who dares to do more is not a man at all.']
['LADY MACBETH', 'If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you                                 when you first told me you wanted to do this? When you dared to do                                 it, that’s when you were a man. And if you go one step                                 further by doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be                                 that much more the man. The time and place weren’t right                                 before, but you would have gone ahead with the murder anyhow. Now                                 the time and place are just right, but they’re almost too                                 good for you. I have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is to                                 love the baby at my breast. But even as the baby was smiling up at                                 me, I would have plucked my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its                                 brains out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the same way you                                 have sworn to do this.']
['MACBETH', 'But if we fail—']
['LADY MACBETH', 'We, fail? If you get your courage up, we can’t fail. When                                 Duncan is asleep—the day’s hard journey has                                 definitely made him tired—I’ll get his two                                 servants so drunk that their memory will go up in smoke through the                                 chimneys of their brains. When they lie asleep like pigs, so drunk                                 they’ll be dead to the world, what won’t you and I                                 be able to do to the unguarded Duncan?

The clock says                                 it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun. Is it                                 because night is so strong, or because day is so weak, that darkness                                 covers the earth when it’s supposed to be light?']

Refusing to be obedient                                 as usual, they acted like they were at war with mankind.']

And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also                                 prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that                                 my sons and grandsons would be kings instead. If the witches tell                                 the truth—which they did about you—maybe                                 what they said about me will come true too. But shhh!

I showed you the proof at                                 our last meeting. I explained how you were deceived, how you were                                 thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working                                 against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a                                 half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did                                 it!”']
['FIRST MURDERER', 'You explained it all.']
['MACBETH', 'I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second                                 meeting. Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going                                 to let him off the hook? Are you so pious that you would pray for                                 this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early                                 grave and put your family in poverty forever?']
['FIRST MURDERER', 'We are men, my lord.']
['MACBETH', 'Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as                                 hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs,                                 swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you                                 list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you                                 can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are                                 clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can                                 classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it                                 from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you                                 occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the                                 very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will                                 tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer                                 to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy                                 when he is dead.']
['SECOND MURDERER', 'My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and                                 I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I                             do.']
['FIRST MURDERER', 'I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and                                 trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it                                 would either fix my life or end it once and for all.']

Since                                 I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him.                                 But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in                                 common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his                                 death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him                                 killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I have to                                 hide my real plans from the public eye for many important                             reasons.']

Within the next hour I’ll tell                                 you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done tonight,                                 away from the palace. Always remember that I must be free from                                 suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo                                 and his son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting rid of Fleance                                 is as important to me as knocking off Banquo. Each of you should                                 make up your own mind about whether you’re going to do                                 this. I’ll come to you soon.']

['MACBETH', 'We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will heal and be                                 as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once                                 again. But the universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth                                 crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and spend my                                 nights tossing and turning with these nightmares I’ve been                                 having. I’d rather be dead than endure this endless mental                                 torture and harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men and                                 sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace.                                 Duncan lies in his grave, through with life’s troubles, and                                 he’s sleeping well. We have already done the worst we can                                 do to him with our treason. After that, nothing can hurt him                                 further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or                                 anything else.']

Talk to him and look at him in a way that will make him feel                                 important. We’re in a dangerous situation, where we have to                                 flatter him and hide our true feelings.']

['MACBETH', 'Argh! I feel like my mind is full of scorpions, my dear wife. You                                 know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive.']

['MACBETH', 'That’s comforting. They can be killed, it’s                                 true. So be cheerful. Before the bat flies through the castle, and                                 before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us                                 it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done.']

Use your bloody and invisible hand to tear up                                 Banquo’s lease on life, which keeps me in fear. (to himself) The sky’s getting                                 dark, and the crow is returning home to the woods. The gentle                                 creatures of the day are falling asleep, while night’s                                 predators are waking up to look for their prey. (to LADY MACBETH) You seem surprised at my words, but don’t                                 question me yet. Bad deeds force you to commit more bad deeds.

When you just want to eat, it’s better to do that at home.                                 When you’re eating out with people, you need to have a                                 little more ceremony.

If the dead are going to return from their graves,                                 then there’s nothing to stop the birds from eating the                                 bodies.

It used to be                                 that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die,                                 and that would be it.

They will tell me more, because                                 I’m determined to know the worst about what’s                                 going to happen. My own safety is the only important thing now.

I have some schemes in my head that I’m                                 planning to put into action.

And                                 what’s worse, you’ve done all this for a man who                                 behaves like a spoiled brat, angry and hateful.

When I work it over with magic spells, the                                 drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with                                 illusions.']
['FIRST WITCH', 'Come on, let’s hurry. She’ll be back again                             soon.']
['LENNOX', 'What I’ve already said shows you we think alike, so you                                 can draw your own conclusions. All I’m saying is that                                 strange things have been going on. Macbeth pitied                                 Duncan—after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out                                 walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must                                 have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime.                                 Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help                                 thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill                                 their gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it                                 saddened                                 MacbethLennox speaks sarcastically throughout this speech, making it clear that he thinks Macbeth is guilty of the murders.Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill those two                                 servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That                                 was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the                                 wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear                                 those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth                                 has handled things well. If he had Duncan’s sons in                                 prison—which I hope won’t                                 happen—they would find out how awful the punishment is                                 for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough                                 of that. I hear that Macduff is out of favor with the king because                                 he speaks his mind too plainly, and because he failed to show up at                                 Macbeth’s feast. Can you tell me where he’s hiding                                 himself?']
['LORD', 'Duncan’s son Malcolm, whose birthright and throne Macbeth                                 has stolen, lives in the English court. There, the saintly King                                 Edward treats Malcolm so well that despite Malcolm’s                                 misfortunes, he’s not deprived of respect. Macduff went                                 there to ask King Edward for help. He wants Edward to help him form                                 an alliance with the people of Northumberland and their lord,                                 Siward. Macduff hopes that with their help—and with the                                 help of God above—he may once again put food on our                                 tables, bring peace back to our nights, free our feasts and banquets                                 from violent murders, allow us to pay proper homage to our king, and                                 receive honors freely. Those are the things we pine for now. Macbeth                                 has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing                                 for war.']

This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts                                 us to say it, was once considered an honest man. You were one of his                                 favorites. He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.                                 I’m inexperienced, but maybe you’re planning to                                 win Macbeth’s favor by betraying me to him. It would be                                 smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial                                 lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.']
['MACDUFF', 'I am not treacherous.']
['MALCOLM', 'But Macbeth is. Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might                                 give way to a royal command. But I beg your pardon. My fears                                 can’t actually make you evil. Angels are still bright even                                 though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven. Even though                                 everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good                             too.']

Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut                                 is added to her wounds. I also think there would be many people                                 willing to fight for me. The English have promised me thousands of                                 troops. But even so, when I have Macbeth’s head under my                                 foot, or stuck on the end of my sword, then my poor country will be                                 plagued by worse evil than it was before. It will suffer worse and                                 in more ways than ever under the reign of the king who follows                                 Macbeth.']

Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids                                 together could not satisfy my lust.

['MACDUFF', 'Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of                                 tyranny. It has caused the downfall of many kings.

Where sighs, groans,                                 and shrieks rip through the air but no one notices. Where violent                                 sorrow is a common emotion. When the funeral bells ring, people no                                 longer ask who died. Good men die before the flowers in their caps                                 wilt.

I have to                                 stand and fight, like a bearIn Shakespeare’s time, bears were tied to stakes and attacked by dogs for the amusement of audiences.bear.Where’s the man who                                 wasn’t born from a woman? He’s the only one                                 I’m afraid of, nobody else.']
['YOUNG SIWARD', 'What’s your name?']
['MACBETH', 'You’ll be afraid to hear it.']
['YOUNG SIWARD', 'No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in                                 hell.']
['MACBETH', 'My name’s Macbeth.']
['YOUNG SIWARD', 'The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.']
['MACBETH', 'No, nor could the devil’s name be more                             frightening.']
['YOUNG SIWARD', 'You lie, you disgusting tyrant. I’ll prove with my sword                                 that I’m not scared of you.']
['MACBETH', 'You were born from a woman. Swords don’t frighten me. I                                 laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.']
['MACDUFF', 'The noise is coming from over there. Tyrant, show your face! If                                 someone other than me kills you, the ghosts of my wife and children                                 will haunt me forever. I can’t be bothered to fight these                                 lame soldiers who only fight for money. I’ll either fight                                 you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused. You                                 must be over there. By the great noise, it sounds like one of the                                 highest-ranking men is being announced. I hope I find him! I ask for                                 nothing more than that.']
['SIWARD', 'Come this way, my lord. The castle has been surrendered without a                                 fight. Macbeth’s soldiers are fighting on both sides. Our                                 noblemen are battling bravely. The victory is almost yours, and it                                 seems like there’s not much left to do.']
['MALCOLM', 'Our enemies fight as if they’re trying not to hurt                             us.']
['SIWARD', 'Sir, enter the castle.']
['MACBETH', 'Why should I commit suicide like one of the ancient Romans? As                                 long as I see enemies of mine alive, I would rather see my sword                                 wound them than me.']
['MACDUFF', 'Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!']
['MACBETH', 'You are the only man I have avoided. But go away now. I’m                                 already guilty of killing your whole family.']
['MACDUFF', 'I have nothing to say to you. My sword will talk for me. You are                                 too evil for words!']
['MACBETH', 'You’re wasting your time trying to wound me. You might as                                 well try to stab the air with your sword. Go fight someone who can                                 be harmed. I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by                                 anyone born from a woman.']
['MACDUFF', 'You can forget about your charm. The evil spirit you serve can                                 tell you that I was not born. They cut me out of my                                 mother’s womb before she could bear me naturally.']
['MACBETH', 'Curse you for telling me this. You’ve fightened away my                                 courage. I don’t believe those evil creatures anymore. They                                 tricked me with their wordgames, raising my hopes and then                                 destroying them. I won’t fight you.']
['MACDUFF', 'Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow,                                 just like they do with deformed animals. We’ll put a                                 picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come                                 see the tyrant!”']
['MACBETH', "I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in                                 front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people. Even though                                 Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting                                 a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.                                 I’ll put up my shield and battle you. Come on,                                 let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries,                                 'Stop! Enough!'"]
['MALCOLM', 'I wish all of our friends could have survived this battle.']
['SIWARD', 'In every battle, some people will always be killed, but judging                                 from the men I see around us, our great victory didn’t cost                                 us very much.']
['MALCOLM', 'Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.']
['ROSS', 'My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death. He                                 only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved                                 that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.']
['SIWARD', 'So he’s dead?']
['ROSS', 'Yes, and he’s been carried off the field. Your grief                                 should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would                                 never end.']
['SIWARD', 'Were his wounds on his front side?']
['ROSS', 'Yes, on his front.']
['SIWARD', 'Well then, he’s God’s soldier now! If I had as                                 many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that                                 any of them would die more honorably than he did. And                                 that’s all there is to it.']
['MALCOLM', 'He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for                             him.']
['SIWARD', 'He is worth no more than that. They tell me he died well, and                                 settled his scores. With that, I hope God is with him! Here comes                                 better news.']
['MACDUFF', 'Hail, king! Because that’s what you are now. Look, here I                                 have Macbeth’s cursed head. We are free from his tyranny. I                                 see that you have the kingdom’s noblemen around you, and                                 they’re thinking the same thing as me. I want them to join                                 me in this loud cheer, Hail, King of Scotland!']
