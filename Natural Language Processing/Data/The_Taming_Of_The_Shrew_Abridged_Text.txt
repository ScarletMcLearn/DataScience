Burn fragrant wood to give the room a pleasant                                 smell, and have musicians at hand, ready to produce sweet, soothing                                 sounds when he awakes. You want to be ready in case he speaks. If he                                 does, bow low and say deferentially, “What would your                                 Honor have us do?” Have one servant wait on him with a                                 basin of rosewater (throw in some petals), have another servant                                 carry a pitcher, and a third a cloth.

It was the play in which you wooed the                                 gentlewoman so successfully. I have forgotten your name, but you                                 were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.']

You might not be able to control your laughter                                 and you might offend him. I warn you, he’s sensitive. The                                 slightest smile provokes him.']

Why ask me what                                 “garment” I’ll wear?

['LUCENTIO', 'Well, Tranio, here we are in fertile Lombardy, garden of Italy,                                 about to fulfill my lifelong dream. You know how I’ve                                 always longed to see the fair city of Padua, famous for its arts and                                 letters, and now, thanks to my father’s generosity, here I                                 am—with his blessing and your good company. So, my                                 trusty servant—and you’ve never let me                                 down—why don’t we settle here for a time to                                 institute a course of study, a really rigorous curriculum. I was                                 born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before                                 me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was                                 one of the BentivoliiThe Bentivolis were one of the leading families of Bologna, wielding great political power and influence.Bentivolii. It’s only fitting that I, his son, reared in                                 Florence, should concentrate on adding more virtuous deeds to my                                 father’s own, stacking them on top of his wealth. For this                                 reason, Tranio, I’ll study ethics and—for the                                 time being, anyway—pursue those areas of philosophyLucentio is referring to the philosophy of Aristotle.philosophy that                                 teach a man how to achieve happiness through virtue.

Leaving Pisa for Padua, I feelLucentio means he is overwhelmed.I feel a little like a                                 thirsty man who turns from a puddle to a vast lake he can drink                                 from.']

Here’s my thought: practice your logic as you chat with                                 your friends, and your rhetoric in ordinary conversation. Use music                                 and poetry to excite your senses. Math and                                 metaphysics—well, I’d play them by ear,                                 spending only as much time on them as you can stand.                                 There’s nothing to be gained from things we take no                                 pleasure in. What I’m saying, sir, is this: study what you                                 most enjoy.']

['BIONDELLO', 'Lucky for him. Wish I could say the same.']
['TRANIO', 'I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that                                 Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter. This is                                 for your master’s sake, not mine. So watch your step when                                 there are other people around. When we’re by ourselves you                                 can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else,                                 address me as your master Lucentio.']
