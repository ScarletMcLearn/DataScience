I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods. I                                 thought he must be feeling the same way I was—wanting to                                 be alone and tired of his own company. I figured he was avoiding me,                                 and I was perfectly happy to leave him alone and keep to                             myself.']
['MONTAGUE', 'He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add                                 drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his                                 sighs. But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes                                 home to escape the light.']

['MONTAGUE', 'I’ve tried, and many of our friends have tried to make                                 him talk, but he keeps his thoughts to himself. He doesn’t                                 want any friend but himself, and though I don’t know                                 whether he’s a good friend                                 to himself, he certainly keeps his own secrets. He’s like a                                 flower bud that won’t open itself up to the world because                                 it’s been poisoned from within by parasites. If we could                                 only find out why he’s sad, we’d be as eager to                                 help him as we were to learn the reason for his sadness.']
['BENVOLIO', 'Look—here he comes. If you don’t mind, please                                 step aside. He’ll either have to tell me what’s                                 wrong or else tell me no over and over.']

['ROMEO', 'What’s sad is that love is supposed to be blind, but it                                 can still make you do whatever it wants. So, where should we eat?

This fight has a lot to do with hatred, but it has more to                                 do with love. O brawling love! O loving hate! Love that comes from                                 nothing! Sad happiness! Serious foolishness! Beautiful things                                 muddled together into an ugly mess!

This                                 is the love I feel, though no one loves me back. Are you                             laughing?']

['ROMEO', 'Good man, why are you crying?']
['BENVOLIO', 'I’m crying because of how sad you are.']
['ROMEO', "Yes, this is what love does. My sadness sits heavy in my chest,                                 and you want to add your own sadness to mine so there’s                                 even more. I have too much sadness already, and now you’re                                 going to make me sadder by feeling sorry for you. Here’s                                 what love is: a smoke made out of lovers' sighs. When the                                 smoke clears, love is a fire burning in your lover’s eyes.                                 If you frustrate love, you get an ocean made out of lovers'                                 tears. What else is love? It’s a wise form of madness.                                 It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on. Goodbye,                             cousin."]

She’s rich in beauty, but she’s                                 also poor, because when she dies her beauty will be destroyed with                                 her.']

Yes, she will. Indeed, I remember                                 it well. It’s been eleven years since the earthquake. She                                 stopped nursing from my breast on that very day. I’ll never                                 forget it. I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting                                 in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse. You and your husband                                 were in Mantua. Boy, do I have some memory! But like I said, when                                 she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe                                 got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast. Then the                                 dovehouse shook with the earthquake. There was no need to tell me to                                 get out of there. That was eleven years ago. By then she could stand                                 up all by herself. No, I swear, by that time she could run and                                 waddle all around. I remember because she had cut her forehead just                                 the day before. My husband—God rest his soul, he was a                                 happy man—picked up the child.                                 “Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on                                 your face?

I bet if I live a thousand years, I’ll never forget                                 it. “Won’t you, Jule,” he said. And                                 the pretty fool stopped crying and said,                                 “Yes.”']

It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.                                 “Yes,” said my husband, “Did you                                 fall on your face?

Romeo groaned for the beautiful                                 Rosaline and said he would die for her, but compared with tender                                 Juliet, Rosaline doesn’t seem beautiful now. Now someone                                 loves Romeo, and he’s in love again—both of                                 them falling for each others' good looks. But he has to                                 make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be                                 his enemy. And she’s been hooked by someone she should                                 fear. Because he’s an enemy, Romeo has no chance to see                                 Juliet and say the things a lover normally says. And                                 Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less                                 opportunity to meet her lover. But love gives them power, and time                                 gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with                                 intense pleasure."]

The Earth                                 is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb. Plants                                 are born out of the Earth, and they are buried in the Earth when                                 they die. From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of                                 plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children                                 with many excellent forms of nourishment. Everything nature creates                                 has some special property, and each one is different. Herbs, plants,                                 and stones possess great power. There is nothing on Earth that is so                                 evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.                                 And there is nothing that does not turn bad if it’s put to                                 the wrong use and abused. Virtue turns to vice if it’s                                 misused. Vice sometimes becomes virtue through the right                             activity.']

Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten                                 times faster than sunbeams. They should be strong enough to push                                 shadows over the dark hills. That’s the way doves carry                                 Venus so fast, and that’s why Cupid has wings that let him                                 fly as fast as the wind. Now it’s noon. That’s                                 three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t                                 come back. If she was young and passionate, she’d move as                                 fast as a ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his                                 words would bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act like                                 they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and                                 colorless, like lead."]

You’ll fight with a man                                 who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored                                 eyes. Only you would look for a fight like that. Your head is as                                 full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been                                 beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting. You started a                                 fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog                                 that was sleeping in the sun. Didn’t you argue it out with                                 your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right                                 season? And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old                                 laces? And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about                                 restraint!']

['BENVOLIO', 'Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo. Romeo                                 spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was.                                 He mentioned that you would not approve of the fight. He said all of                                 this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of respect. But he could                                 not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and                                 wouldn’t listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio                                 began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and                                 dodging each other’s blows. Romeo cried out,                                 “Stop, my friends. Break it up.” Then he                                 jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down. But                                 Tybalt reached under Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into                                 brave Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene.']

I demand justice.                                 You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice. Romeo killed                                 Tybalt. Romeo must die.']

He deserves                                 only honor, complete honor. Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at                                 him.']
['NURSE', 'Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your                                 cousin?']
['JULIET', 'Am I supposed to say bad things about my own husband? Ah, my poor                                 husband, who will sing your praises when I, your wife of three                                 hours, have been saying awful things about you? But why, you                                 villain, did you kill my cousin? Probably because my cousin the                                 villain would have killed my husband. I’m not going to cry                                 any tears. I would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I should                                 cry tears of grief because Tybalt is dead. My husband, whom Tybalt                                 wanted to kill, is alive. Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is                                 dead. All this is comforting news. Why, then, should I cry? There is                                 news worse than the news that Tybalt is dead, news that makes me                                 want to die. I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my                                 memory like sins linger in guilty minds. “Tybalt is                                 dead, and Romeo has been banished.”']
['NURSE', 'They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse. Are you                                 going to join them? I’ll bring you there.']
['JULIET', 'Are they washing out his wounds with their tears? I’ll                                 cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are                                 dry. Pick up this rope ladder. This poor rope ladder, it’s                                 useless now, just like me, because Romeo has been exiled. He made                                 this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I                                 will die a virgin and a widow. Let’s go, rope ladder.                                 Nurse, I’m going to lie in my wedding bed. And death, not                                 Romeo, can take my virginity!']

['ROMEO', 'Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than                             doomsday?']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'He made a gentler decision. You won’t die, but                                 you’ll be banished from the city.']
['ROMEO', 'Ha, banishment? Be merciful and say                                 “death.” Exile is much worse than death.                                 Don’t say “banishment.”']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'From now on, you are banished from Verona. You should be able to                                 endure this because the world is broad and wide.']
['ROMEO', 'There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except                                 purgatory, torture, and hell itself. So to be banished from Verona                                 is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the                                 world is death.']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Oh, deadly sin! Oh, rude and unthankful boy! You committed a crime                                 that is punishable by death, but our kind Prince took sympathy on                                 you and ignored the law when he substituted banishment for death.                                 This is kind mercy, and you don’t realize it.']
['ROMEO', 'It’s torture, not mercy. Heaven is here because Juliet                                 lives here. Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy                                 animal that lives here can see her, but Romeo can’t. Flies                                 are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than                                 Romeo. They can take hold of Juliet’s wonderful white hand                                 and they can kiss her sweet lips. Even while she remains a pure                                 virgin, she blushes when her lips touch each other because she                                 thinks it’s a sin. But Romeo can’t kiss her or                                 hold her hand because he’s been banished. Flies can kiss                                 her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like free men, but I have                                 been banished. And yet you say that exile is not death? Did you have                                 no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me                                 quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment? Oh Friar, damned                                 souls use the word banishment to describe hell. They howl about                                 banishment. If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order                                 of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how                                 do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.']
['ROMEO', 'Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment                             again.']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'I’ll give you protection from that word. I’ll                                 give you the antidote for trouble: philosophy. Philosophy will                                 comfort you even though you’ve been banished.']
['ROMEO', 'You’re still talking about                                 “banished?” Forget about philosophy! Unless                                 philosophy can create a Juliet, or pick up a town and put it                                 somewhere else, or reverse a prince’s punishment, it                                 doesn’t do me any good. Don’t say anything                             else.']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.']
['ROMEO', 'How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even                             see?']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Let me talk to you about your situation.']
['ROMEO', 'You can’t talk about something that you don’t                                 feel.

You might also tear your hair out of your                                 head and collapse to the ground the way I do right now.

['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Hold on, and don’t act out of desperation. Are you a man?                                 You look like a man, but your tears make you look like a woman. Your                                 wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.                                 You’re a shameful woman who looks like a man or else an                                 ugly creature who’s half-man, half-beast. You have amazed                                 me. I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more                                 rational than this. Have you killed Tybalt? Will you kill yourself?                                 And would you also kill your wife, who shares your life, by                                 committing the sin of killing yourself? Why do you complain about                                 your birth, the heavens, and the earth? Life is the union of soul in                                 body through the miracle of birth, but you would throw all that                                 away. You bring shame to your body, your love, and your mind. You                                 have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you                                 use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your                                 body, not your love, not your mind. Your body is just a wax figure,                                 without the honor of a man. The love that you promised was a hollow                                 lie. You’re killing the love that you vowed to cherish.                                 Your mind, which aids both your body and your love, has mishandled                                 both of them. You’re like a stupid soldier whose gunpowder                                 explodes because he’s careless. The things you were                                 supposed to use to defend yourself end up killing you. Get up, man!                                 Your Juliet is alive. It was for her that you were almost killed                                 earlier. Be happy that she’s alive. Tybalt wanted to kill                                 you, but you killed Tybalt. Be happy that you’re alive. The                                 law that threatened your life was softened into exile. Be happy                                 about that. Your life is full of blessings. You have the best sorts                                 of happiness to enjoy.']

Then, since things are the way they are, I think the                                 best thing to do is to marry the count. Oh, he’s a lovely                                 gentleman! Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him. Madam, an                                 eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes                                 of Paris. Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in                                 this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.                                 Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over. Or if                                 Romeo is as good as Paris, Romeo doesn’t live here, so you                                 don’t get to enjoy him.']
['JULIET', 'Are you speaking from your heart?']

['JULIET', 'Well, you have given me great comfort. Go inside and tell my                                 mother that I’m gone. I made my father angry, so I went to                                 Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.']
['NURSE', 'Alright, I will. This is a good idea.']
['JULIET', 'That damned old lady! Oh, that most wicked fiend! Is it a worse                                 sin for her to want me to break my vows or for her to say bad things                                 about my husband after she praised him so many times before? Away                                 with you and your advice, Nurse. From now on, I will never tell you                                 what I feel in my heart. I’m going to the Friar to find out                                 his solution. If everything else fails, at least I have the power to                                 take my own life.']

Now, sir,                                 her father thinks it’s dangerous that she allows herself to                                 become so sad. He’s being smart by rushing our marriage to                                 stop her from crying. She cries too much by herself. If she had                                 someone to be with her, she would stop crying. Now you know the                                 reason for the rush.']

['JULIET', 'I’ll confess to you that I love him.']
['PARIS', 'You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.']

['PARIS', 'You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.']
['JULIET', 'The tears haven’t done much because my face looked bad                                 enough before I started to cry.']

I want                                 to die if what you say isn’t another solution.']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Hold on, daughter, I see some hope. But we must act boldly because                                 the situation is so desperate.

You can wrestle with death to escape                                 from shame. And if you dare to do it, I’ll give you the                                 solution.']

Or tell me to sit                                 in a field full of poisonous snakes. Chain me up with wild bears.

All                                 those ideas make me tremble when I hear them named. But I will do                                 them without fear or dread in order to be a pure wife to my sweet                                 love.']
['FRIAR LAWRENCE', 'Hold on, then. Go home, be cheerful, and tell them you agree to                                 marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday.

Then a cold, sleep-inducing drug will run through                                 your veins, and your pulse will stop. Your flesh will be cold, and                                 you’ll stop breathing. The red in your lips and your cheeks                                 will turn pale, and your eyes will shut. It will seem like                                 you’re dead. You won’t be able to move, and your                                 body will be stiff like a corpse. You’ll remain in this                                 deathlike state for forty-two hours, and then you’ll wake                                 up as if from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom comes to                                 get you out of bed on Thursday morning, you’ll seem dead.                                 Then, as tradition demands, you’ll be dressed up in your                                 best clothes, put in an open coffin, and carried to the Capulet                                 family tomb. Meanwhile, I’ll send Romeo word of our plan.                                 He’ll come here, and we’ll keep a watch for when                                 you wake up. That night, Romeo will take you away to Mantua. This                                 plan will free you from the shameful situation that troubles you now                                 as long as you don’t change your mind, or become scared                                 like a silly woman and ruin your brave effort.']

Romeo, who lies there dead, was the husband                                 of that Juliet. And she, who lies there dead, was that                                 Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; their secret wedding                                 day was the day Tybalt died. His untimely death caused the                                 bridegroom to be banished from the city. Juliet was sad because                                 Romeo was gone, not because of Tybalt’s death. To cure her                                 sadness, you arranged a marriage for her with Count Paris. Then she                                 came to me, and, looking wild, she asked me to devise a plan to get                                 her out of this second marriage. She threatened to kill herself in                                 my cell if I didn’t help her. So I gave her a sleeping                                 potion that I had mixed with my special skills. It worked as                                 planned. She seemed to everyone to be dead.']
