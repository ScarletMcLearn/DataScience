['BARNARDO', 'Who’s there?']
['FRANCISCO', 'No, who are you? Stop and identify                                 yourself.']
['BARNARDO', 'Long live the king!']
['FRANCISCO', 'Is that Barnardo?']
['BARNARDO', 'Yes, it’s me.']
['FRANCISCO', 'You’ve come right on time.']
['BARNARDO', 'The clock’s just striking twelve. Go home to bed,                                 Francisco.']
['FRANCISCO', 'Thanks for letting me go. It’s bitterly cold out, and                                 I’m depressed.']
['BARNARDO', 'Has it been a quiet night?']
['FRANCISCO', 'I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.']
['BARNARDO', 'Well, good night. If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who                                 are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to                             hurry.']
['FRANCISCO', 'I think I hear them. —Stop! Who’s                             there?']
['HORATIO', 'Friends of this country.']
['MARCELLUS', 'And servants of the Danish king.']
['FRANCISCO', 'Good night to you both.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Good-bye. Who’s taken over the watch for you?']
['FRANCISCO', 'Barnardo’s taken my place. Good night.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Hello, Barnardo.']
['BARNARDO', 'Hello. Is Horatio here too?']
['HORATIO', 'More or less.']
['BARNARDO', 'Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, Marcellus.']
['MARCELLUS', 'So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?']
['BARNARDO', 'I haven’t seen anything.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t                                 let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that                                 we’ve seen twice now. That’s why                                 I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if                                 the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.']
['HORATIO', 'Oh, nonsense. It’s not going to appear.']
['BARNARDO', 'Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the                                 story you don’t want to believe, about what                                 we’ve seen two nights now.']
['HORATIO', 'Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell                             us.']
['BARNARDO', "Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had                                 traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s                                 shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and                             I—"]
['MARCELLUS', 'Quiet, shut up! It’s come again.']
['BARNARDO', 'Looking just like the dead king.']
['MARCELLUS', ' (to                                 HORATIO) You’re                                 well-educated, Horatio. Say something to it.']
['BARNARDO', 'Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio?']
['HORATIO', 'Very much so. It’s terrifying.']
['BARNARDO', 'It wants us to speak to it.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Ask it something, Horatio.']
['HORATIO', 'What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the                                 dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle? By God, I order you                                 to speak.']
['MARCELLUS', 'It looks like you’ve offended it.']
['BARNARDO', 'Look, it’s going away.']
['HORATIO', 'Stay! Speak! Speak! I order you, speak!']
['MARCELLUS', 'It’s gone. It won’t answer now.']
['BARNARDO', 'What’s going on, Horatio? You’re pale and                                 trembling. You agree now that we’re not imagining this,                                 don’t you? What do you think about it?']
['HORATIO', 'I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes                                 I’d never believe it.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Doesn’t it look like the king?']
['HORATIO', 'Yes, as much as you look like yourself. The king was wearing                                 exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway. And the ghost                                 frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles,                                 traveling on the ice in sleds. It’s weird.']
['MARCELLUS', 'It’s happened like this twice before, always at this                                 exact time. He stalks by us at our post like a warrior.']
['HORATIO', 'I don’t know exactly how to explain this, but I have a                                 general feeling this means bad news for our country.']
['MARCELLUS', 'All right, let’s sit down and discuss that question.                                 Somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been                                 imposed, and why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured in                                 Denmark, and so many weapons bought from abroad, and why the                                 shipbuilders are so busy they don’t even rest on Sunday.                                 Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and                                 day? Who can explain this to me?']
['HORATIO', 'I can. Or at least I can describe the rumors. As you know, our                                 late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of                                 Fortinbras, king of Norway. Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that                                 fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we                                 thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the                                 basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his                                 territories, along with his life, to his conqueror. If our king had                                 lost, he would have had to do the same. But now old                                 Fortinbras’s young son, also called                                 Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has                                 gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country.                                 For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough                                 enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost.']
['BARNARDO', 'I think that’s exactly right—that explains                                 why the ghost of the late king would haunt us now, since he caused                                 these wars.']
['HORATIO', 'The ghost is definitely something to worry about. In the high and                                 mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was                                 assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the                                 streets of Rome speaking gibberish. There were shooting stars, and                                 blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the                                 face of the sun. The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was                                 so eclipsed it almost went completely out. And we’ve had                                 similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth                                 have joined together to warn us what’s going to                             happen.']
['MARCELLUS', 'Should I strike it with my spear?']
['HORATIO', 'Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.']
['BARNARDO', 'It’s over here.']
['HORATIO', 'There it is.']
['MARCELLUS', 'It’s gone. We were wrong to threaten it with violence,                                 since it looks so much like a king. Besides, we can’t                                 hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air. Our attack was stupid,                                 futile, and wicked.']
['BARNARDO', 'It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.']
['HORATIO', 'And then it acted startled, like a guilty person caught by the                                 law. I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day                                 with its trumpetlike crowing, and makes all wandering ghosts,                                 wherever they are, hurry back to their hiding places.                                 We’ve just seen proof of that.']
['MARCELLUS', "Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed. Some people say that                                 just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long, so that no                                 ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe. The planets have no                                 sway over us, fairies' spells don’t work, and                                 witches can’t bewitch us. That’s how holy that                                 night is."]
['HORATIO', 'Yes, I’ve heard the same thing and sort of believe it.                                 But look, morning is breaking beyond that hill in the east, turning                                 the sky red. Let’s interrupt our watch and go tell young                                 Hamlet what we’ve seen tonight. I’m sure this                                 ghost that’s so silent with us will speak to him.                                 Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about                                 this, out of duty and love?']
['MARCELLUS', 'Let’s do it. I know where we’ll find him                                 this morning.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder                                 Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him                                 throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think                                 it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own                                 well being. Therefore, I’ve married my former                                 sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and                                 sadness. I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing                                 what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I                                 thank you. Now, down to business. You all know what’s                                 happening. Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or                                 imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into                                 turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops                                 pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father                                 lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law. So much for                                 Fortinbras.']
['CORNELIUS, VOLTEMAND', 'We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything                             else.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'I have no doubt you will. Good-bye.']
['LAERTES', 'My lord, I want your permission to go back to France, which I left                                 to come to Denmark for your coronation. I confess, my thoughts are                                 on France, now that my duty is done. Please, let me go.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Do you have your father’s permission? What does                                 Polonius say?']
['POLONIUS', 'My son has worn me down by asking me so many times. In the end I                                 grudgingly consented. I beg you, let him go.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'In that case, leave when you like, Laertes, and spend your time                                 however you wish. I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a                                 good time. And now, Hamlet, my nephew and my son—']
['HAMLET', ' (speaking so no one else can hear)                                 Too many family ties there for me.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Why are you still so gloomy, with a cloud hanging over you?']
['HAMLET', 'It’s not true, sir. Your son is out in the sun.']
['GERTRUDE', 'My dear Hamlet, stop wearing these black clothes, and be friendly                                 to the king. You can’t spend your whole life with your                                 eyes to the ground remembering your noble father. It happens all the                                 time, what lives must die eventually, passing to eternity.']
['HAMLET', 'Yes, mother, it happens all the time.']
['GERTRUDE', 'So why does it seem so particular to you?']
['HAMLET', '“Seem,” mother? No, it                                 is. I don’t know what you                                 mean by “seem.” Neither my black clothes, my                                 dear mother, nor my heavy sighs, nor my weeping, nor my downcast                                 eyes, nor any other display of grief can show what I really feel.                                 It’s true that all these things                                 “seem” like grief, since a person could use                                 them to fake grief if he wanted to. But I’ve got more                                 real grief inside me that you could ever see on the surface. These                                 clothes are just a hint of it.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father                                 like this. But you have to remember, that your father lost his                                 father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has                                 had to mourn his father for a certain period. But overdoing it is                                 just stubborn. It’s not manly. It’s not what                                 God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and                                 weak mind. Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why                                 should we take it to heart? You’re committing a crime                                 against heaven, against the dead, and against nature. And                                 it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers                                 must die. Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start                                 thinking of me as your new father.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Please answer my prayers, Hamlet, and stay with us.                                 Don’t go back to Wittenberg.']
['HAMLET', "I’ll obey you as well as I can,                             ma'am."]
['CLAUDIUS', 'That’s the right answer—it shows your love.                                 Stay in Denmark like us.—My dear wife, come.                                 Hamlet’s agreeing to stay makes me happy, and every merry                                 toast I’ll drink today will be heard as far as the clouds                                 overhead. My drinking will be echoed in the heavens.                                 Let’s go.']
['HAMLET', 'Ah, I wish my dirty flesh could melt away into a vapor, or that                                 God had not made a law against suicide. Oh God, God! How tired,                                 stale, and pointless life is to me. Damn it! It’s like a                                 garden that no one’s taking care of, and                                 that’s growing wild. Only nasty weeds grow in it now. I                                 can’t believe it’s come to this. My                                 father’s only been dead for two months—no, not                                 even two. Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god                                 is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind                                 from blowing too hard on her face.']
['HORATIO', 'Hello, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name,                                 right?']
['HORATIO', 'That’s me, sir. Still your respectful servant.']
['HAMLET', 'Not my servant, but my friend. I’ll change that name                                 for you. But what are you doing so far from Wittenberg, Horatio?                                 —Oh, Marcellus?']

['HORATIO', 'I felt like skipping school, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I                                 won’t believe it from you. I know you’d never                                 skip school. What are you doing here in Elsinore? I’ll                                 teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.']
['HORATIO', 'Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.']
['HAMLET', 'Please, don’t make fun of me. I think you came to see                                 my mother’s wedding instead.']
['HORATIO', 'Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.']
['HAMLET', 'It was all about saving a few bucks, Horatio. The leftovers from                                 the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet. Oh,                                 I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio,                                 than have lived through that terrible day! My father—I                                 think I see my father.']
['HORATIO', 'Where, sir?']
['HAMLET', 'In my imagination, Horatio.']
['HORATIO', 'I saw him once. He was an admirable king.']
['HAMLET', 'He was a great human being. He was perfect in everything.                                 I’ll never see the likes of him again.']
['HORATIO', 'Sir, I think I saw him last night.']
['HAMLET', 'Saw who?']
['HORATIO', 'Your father, sir. The dead king.']
['HAMLET', 'The king my father?!']
['HORATIO', 'Don’t get too excited yet, sir. Just listen carefully                                 while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as                                 witnesses.']
['HAMLET', 'For God’s sake, let me hear it.']
['HORATIO', 'After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards,                                 Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your                                 father, in full armor from head to toe. It just appeared before them                                 and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a                                 staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they                                 turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak. They told me all                                 about this, so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with                                 them, to see for myself. It happened again, just as they had                                 described. I knew your father. This ghost looked as much like him as                                 my two hands are like each other.']
['HAMLET', 'But where did this happen?']
['MARCELLUS', 'On the platform where we stand guard, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'Didn’t you talk to it?']
['HORATIO', 'I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me. It raised its head                                 once as if it was about to speak, but just then the rooster started                                 crowing, and the ghost vanished from sight.']
['HAMLET', 'That’s very strange.']
['HORATIO', 'I swear to God it’s true, sir. We thought you ought to                                 know about it.']
['HAMLET', 'Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me. Are you on duty again                                 tonight?']
['MARCELLUS, BARNARDO', 'Yes, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'It was armed, you say?']
['MARCELLUS, BARNARDO', 'Armed, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'From head to toe?']
['MARCELLUS, BARNARDO', 'Yes, from top to bottom, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'So you couldn’t see his face, then?']
['HORATIO', 'Oh, yes, we could, sir. He had his helmet visor up.']
['HAMLET', 'Was he frowning?']
['HORATIO', 'He looked more sad than angry.']
['HAMLET', 'Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?']
['HORATIO', 'Very pale, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'Did he stare at you?']
['HORATIO', 'The whole time.']
['HAMLET', 'I wish I’d been there.']
['HORATIO', 'You would have been very shocked.']
['HAMLET', 'I’m sure I would have. Did it stay a long time?']
['HORATIO', 'About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a                                 hundred.']
['MARCELLUS, BARNARDO', 'No, longer than that.']
['HORATIO', 'Not the time I saw it.']
['HAMLET', 'His beard was gray, right?']
['HORATIO', 'It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in                                 it.']
['HAMLET', 'I’ll stand guard with you tonight. Maybe                                 it’ll come again.']
['HORATIO', 'I bet it will.']
['HAMLET', "If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even                                 if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet. I ask you, if                                 you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so. Whatever                                 happens tonight, don’t talk about it. I’ll                                 return the favor. So good-bye for now. I’ll see you on                                 the guards' platform between eleven and twelve                             tonight."]
['HORATIO, MARCELLUS, BARNARDO', 'We’ll do our duty to you, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'Give me your love instead, as I give you mine. Good-bye.']
['LAERTES', 'My belongings are on the ship already. Good-bye. And, my dear                                 sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let                                 me hear from you—write.']
['OPHELIA', 'Do you doubt I’ll write?']
['LAERTES', 'As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big                                 flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth. It                                 won’t last. It’s sweet, but his affection will                                 fade after a minute. Not a second more.']
['OPHELIA', 'No more than a minute?']
['LAERTES', 'Try to think of it like that, anyway. When a youth grows into a                                 man, he doesn’t just get bigger in his                                 body—his responsibilities grow too. He may love you now,                                 and may have only the best intentions, but you have to be on your                                 guard. Remember that he belongs to the royal family, and his                                 intentions don’t matter that                                 much—he’s a slave to his family obligations.                                 He can’t simply make personal choices for himself the way                                 common people can, since the whole country depends on what he does.                                 His choice has to agree with what the nation wants.']
['OPHELIA', 'I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart. But,                                 my dear brother, don’t be like a bad priest who fails to                                 practice what he preaches, showing me the steep and narrow way to                                 heaven while you frolic on the primrose path of sin.']
['LAERTES', 'Don’t worry, I won’t.']
['POLONIUS', 'You’re still here? Shame on you—get on                                 board! The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and                                 they’re waiting for you. Here, I give you my blessing                                 again. And just try to remember a few rules of life.                                 Don’t say what you’re thinking, and                                 don’t be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly                                 to people but don’t overdo it. Once you’ve                                 tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them.                                 But don’t waste your time shaking hands with every new                                 guy you meet. Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once                                 you’re in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but                                 talk to few. Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your                                 judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure                                 they’re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the                                 man—which is doubly true in France. Don’t                                 borrow money and don’t lend it, since when you lend to a                                 friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and                                 borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true                                 to yourself. Then you won’t be false to anybody else.                                 Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what                                 I’ve said.']
['LAERTES', 'I humbly say good-bye to you, father.']
['POLONIUS', 'Now go, the time is right. Your servants are waiting.']
['LAERTES', 'Good-bye, Ophelia. Remember what I’ve told you.']
['OPHELIA', 'It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve                                 got the key.']
['LAERTES', 'Good-bye.']
['POLONIUS', 'What did he tell you, Ophelia?']
['OPHELIA', 'Something about Hamlet.']
['POLONIUS', 'A good thing he did, by God. I’ve heard                                 Hamlet’s been spending a lot of time alone with you                                 recently, and you’ve made yourself quite available to                                 him. If things are the way people tell me they are—and                                 they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I                                 have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the                                 self-restraint a daughter of mine should show. What’s                                 going on between you two? Tell me the truth.']
['OPHELIA', 'He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.']
['POLONIUS', '“Affection!” That’s nothing!                                 You’re talking like some innocent girl who                                 doesn’t understand the ways of the world. Do you believe                                 his “offers,” as you call them?']
['OPHELIA', 'I don’t know what to believe, father.']
['POLONIUS', 'Then I’ll tell you. Believe that you are a foolish                                 little baby for believing these “offers” are                                 something real. Offer yourself more respect, or—not to                                 beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the                                 chance to be a laughing-stock.']
['OPHELIA', 'Father, he’s always talked about love in an honorable                                 fashion—']
['POLONIUS', 'Yes, “fashion” is just the word—a                                 passing whim. Go on.']
['OPHELIA', 'And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what                                 he says.']
['POLONIUS', 'These vows are just traps for stupid birds. I know when a man is                                 on fire, he’ll swear anything. But when a                                 heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and                                 the fire will be out even before he’s done making his                                 promises. Don’t mistake that for true love. From now on,                                 spend a little less time with him and talk to him less. Make                                 yourself a precious commodity. Remember that Hamlet is young and has                                 a lot more freedom to fool around than you do. In short, Ophelia,                                 don’t believe his love vows, since they’re                                 like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy                                 acts. To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with                                 Hamlet. Do as I say.']
['OPHELIA', 'I’ll do as you say, father.']
['HAMLET', 'The air is biting cold.']
['HORATIO', 'Yes, it’s definitely nippy.']
['HAMLET', 'What time is it?']
['HORATIO', 'A little before twelve, I think.']
['MARCELLUS', 'No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock                             strike.']
['HORATIO', 'Really? I didn’t hear it. So it’s nearly the                                 time when the ghost likes to appear.']
['HAMLET', 'The king is staying up all night drinking and dancing. As he                                 guzzles down his German wine, the musicians make a ruckus to                                 celebrate his draining another cup.']
['HORATIO', 'Is that a tradition?']
['HAMLET', 'Yes, it is. But though I was born here and should consider that                                 tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to                                 ignore it than practice it. Other countries criticize us for our                                 loud partying.']
['HORATIO', 'Look, sir—here it comes!']
['HAMLET', 'Oh angels, protect us!

['MARCELLUS', 'Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place                                 that’s farther away. But don’t go.']

I’ll follow                             it.']
['HORATIO', 'What if it tempts you to jump into the sea, sir? Or to the                                 terrifying cliff that overhangs the water,']

['HORATIO', 'His imagination is making him crazy.']

['MARCELLUS', 'It means that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.']
['HORATIO', 'If that’s true, we should let God take care of                             it.']

Now listen, Hamlet. Everyone was                                 told that a poisonous snake bit me when I was sleeping in the                                 orchard.

['HAMLET', 'I knew it! My uncle?']
['GHOST', 'Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and                                 fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her                                 to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her                                 like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved                                 her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage,                                 to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just                                 as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter                                 how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her                                 can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage.                                 But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief                                 here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard,                                 as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of                                 henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like                                 quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just                                 what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my                                 smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my                                 brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He                                 cut me off in the middle of a sinful life.']

You’ve probably                                 heard about the “change” that’s                                 come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it,                                 since inside and out he’s different from what he was                                 before. I can’t imagine what’s made him so                                 unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you                                 both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and                                 behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and                                 spend some time with him. See if you can get Hamlet to have some                                 fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular                                 that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix                                 it.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know                                 there are no two men alive he’s fonder of. If                                 you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help                                 us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your                                 command, instead of asking us so politely.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'But we’ll obey. Our services are entirely at your                                 command.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!']
['GERTRUDE', 'Amen to that!']
['POLONIUS', 'The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Once again you bring good news.']
['POLONIUS', 'Do I, sir? I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty                                 both to my God and my good king. ']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Tell me! I want very much to find out.']
['POLONIUS', 'All right, but first let the ambassadors speak. Then you can hear                                 my news, as dessert.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Then be so kind as to show them in.']
['GERTRUDE', 'I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his                                 father’s dying and our quick marriage.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Welcome, my good                                 friends. Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the                                 king of Norway?']
['VOLTEMAND', 'Greetings to you too, your Highness. As soon as we raised the                                 matter, the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew’s                                 war preparations, which he originally thought were directed against                                 Poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you.                                 He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being                                 old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s                                 arrest. Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this                                 and think about how to reply. Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.                                 Go relax now. Tonight we’ll have dinner. Welcome                             back!']
['POLONIUS', 'Well, that turned out well in the end. Sir and madam, to make                                 grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is                                 day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of                                 day, night, and time. Therefore, since the essence of wisdom is not                                 talking too much, I’ll get right to the point here. Your                                 son is crazy. “Crazy” I’m calling                                 it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that                                 it’s craziness? But that’s another                             story.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Please, stick to the point.']
['POLONIUS', 'Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point.                                 It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a                                 shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame                                 he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so                                 I’ll get right to the point.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Hamlet wrote this letter to Ophelia?']
['POLONIUS', 'Madam, please be patient. I’ll read it to you.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'And how did she react to all this?']
['POLONIUS', 'Sir, what is your opinion of me?']
['CLAUDIUS', 'I know you are loyal and honorable.']
['POLONIUS', 'I would like to prove to you that I am. But what would you have                                 thought of me if I had kept quiet when I found out about this hot                                 little love (which I noticed even before my daughter told me about                                 it)? My dear queen, what would you have thought of me if I had                                 turned a blind eye to what was happening between Hamlet and my                                 daughter? No, I had to do something. And so I said to my daughter:                                 “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your                                 league. You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders                                 to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little                                 gifts from him. She did what I said. When she rejected Hamlet, he                                 became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got                                 dizzy, and as a result lost his mind. And that’s why                                 he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him.']
['CLAUDIUS', ' (to                                 GERTRUDE) Do you think                                 that’s why Hamlet’s crazy?']
['GERTRUDE', 'It may be, it certainly may be.']
['POLONIUS', 'Has there ever been a time—I’d really like                                 to know—when I’ve definitely said something                                 was true, and it turned out not to be true?']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Not that I know of.']
['POLONIUS', ' (pointing to his head and                                 shoulders)                                 Chop my head off if I’m wrong. I’ll follow the                                 clues and uncover the truth, even if it’s at the very                                 center of the earth.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'What can we do to find out if it’s true?']
['POLONIUS', 'Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours                                 at a time.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Yes, he does.']
['POLONIUS', 'When he’s there next time, I’ll send my                                 daughter to see him. (to CLAUDIUS) You and I will hide behind the arrasAn arras is a hanging wall-tapestry.arras and watch what happens. If it turns out that                                 Hamlet’s not in love after all, and hasn’t                                 gone mad from love, then you can fire me from my court job and                                 I’ll go work on a farm.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'We’ll try what you suggest.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Look how sadly he’s coming in, reading his book.']
['POLONIUS', 'Please go away, both of you. I’ll speak to him now. Oh,                                 please let me.']
['HAMLET', 'Fine, thank you.']
['POLONIUS', 'Do you know who I am?']
['HAMLET', 'Of course. You sell fish.']
['POLONIUS', 'No, not me, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish                             seller.']
['POLONIUS', 'Good, sir?']
['HAMLET', 'Yes, sir. Only one man in ten thousand is good in this                             world.']
['POLONIUS', 'That’s definitely true, my lord.']
['HAMLET', 'Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the                                 corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?']
['POLONIUS', 'I do indeed, my lord.']
['HAMLET', 'Then by all means never let her walk in public. Procreation is a                                 good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look                                 out, friend.']
['POLONIUS', ' (to himself) Now, what does he mean                                 by that? Still harping on my daughter. But he didn’t                                 recognize me at first. He mistook me for a fish seller.                                 He’s far gone. But when I was young I went crazy for love                                 too, almost as bad as this. I’ll talk to him                                 again.—(to                                 HAMLET) What are you reading, your                                 highness?']
['HAMLET', 'A lot of words.']
['POLONIUS', 'And what is the subject?']
['HAMLET', 'Between whom?']
['POLONIUS', 'I mean, what do the words say?']
['HAMLET', 'Oh, just lies, sir. The sly writer says here that old men have                                 gray beards, their faces are wrinkled, their eyes full of gunk, and                                 that they have no wisdom and weak thighs. Of course I believe it                                 all, but I don’t think it’s good manners to                                 write it down, since you yourself, sir, would grow as old as I am,                                 if you could only travel backward like a crab.']
['POLONIUS', ' (to himself) There’s a                                 method to his madness. (to                                 HAMLET) Will you step outside, my                                 lord?']

He has a way with words, as crazy people often                                 do, and that sane people don’t have a talent for.

['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Oh, as well as anybody.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too                                 lucky. We’re not exactly at the top of our luck.']
['HAMLET', 'But you’re not down and out, either, are you?']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'No, we’re just somewhere in the middle, my lord.']
['HAMLET', 'So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'Yes, we’re the privates in her army.']
['HAMLET', 'Ha, ha, so you’ve gotten into her private parts? Of                                 course—Lady Luck is such a slut. Anyway,                                 what’s up?']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Not much, my lord. Just that the world’s become                             honest.']
['HAMLET', 'In that case, the end of the world is approaching. But                                 you’re wrong. Let me ask you a particular question. What                                 crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'Prison, my lord?']
['HAMLET', 'Denmark’s a prison.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Then I guess the whole world is one.']
['HAMLET', 'Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark                                 being one of the worst.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'We don’t think so, my lord.']
['HAMLET', 'Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really                                 good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person                                 thinks about it. And to me, Denmark is a prison.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'That must be because you’re so ambitious.                                 It’s too small for your large mind.']
['HAMLET', 'Small? No, I could live in a walnut shell and feel like the king                                 of the universe. The real problem is that I have bad dreams.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than                                 the shadow of a dream.']
['HAMLET', 'But a dream itself is just a shadow.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Exactly. In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that                                 it’s only the shadow of a shadow.']
['HAMLET', 'Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious                                 kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars. Should we go                                 inside? I seem to be losing my mind a bit.']
['ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN', 'We’re at your service, whatever you say.']
['HAMLET', 'No, no, I won’t class you with my servants,                                 since—to be frank with you—my servants are                                 terrible. But tell me as my friends, what are you doing here at                                 Elsinore?']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Visiting you, my lord. There’s no other reason.']
['HAMLET', 'Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that                                 even my thanks are not worth much. Did someone tell you to visit me?                                 Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative? Come on, tell me                                 the truth.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'What should we say, my lord?']
['HAMLET', 'Anything you like, as long as it answers my question. You were                                 sent for. You’ve got a guilty look on your faces, which                                 you’re too honest to disguise. I know the king and queen                                 sent for you.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Why would they do that, my lord?']
['HAMLET', 'That’s what I want you to tell me. Let me remind you of                                 our old friendship, our youth spent together, the duties of our love                                 for each other, and whatever else will make you answer me                             straight.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', ' (to                                 GUILDENSTERN) What do you                             think?']
['HAMLET', ' (to himself) I’ve got my                                 eye on you. (to                                 GUILDENSTERN) If you care about me,                                 you’ll be honest with me.']
['GUILDENSTERN', 'My lord, we were sent for.']
['HAMLET', 'I’ll tell you why—so you won’t                                 have to tell me and give away any                                 secrets you have with the king and queen. Recently, though I                                 don’t know why, I’ve lost all sense of fun,                                 stopped exercising—the whole world feels sterile and                                 empty. This beautiful canopy we call the sky—this                                 majestic roof decorated with golden sunlight—why,                                 it’s nothing more to me than disease-filled air. What a                                 perfect invention a human is, how noble in his capacity to reason,                                 how unlimited in thinking, how admirable in his shape and movement,                                 how angelic in action, how godlike in understanding!                                 There’s nothing more beautiful. We surpass all other                                 animals. And yet to me, what are we but dust? Men don’t                                 interest me. No—women neither, but you’re                                 smiling, so you must think they do.']

He used to be the jewel of our                                 country, the obvious heir to the throne, the one everyone admired                                 and imitated. And now he has fallen so low! And of all the miserable                                 women who once enjoyed hearing his sweet, seductive words, I am the                                 most miserable. A mind that used to sing so sweetly is now                                 completely out of tune, making harsh sounds instead of fine notes.

Don’t use too many                                 hand gestures; just do a few, gently, like this.

Watch my uncle carefully when                                 that scene begins. If his guilty secret does not reveal itself, then                                 that ghost was just a devil, and my hunch wasn’t, in                                 fact, worth anything.']

['PLAYER QUEEN', ' Someone might marry a second time for                                     money, but never for love. Any time I kissed my second husband                                     in bed, I’d kill the first one all over                                 again.']
['PLAYER KING', ' I know that’s what you think                                     now, but people change their minds. Often our intentions are                                     strong at first, but as time goes on they weaken, just like an                                     apple sticks to the tree when it is unripe but falls to the                                     ground once it ripens. The promises we make to ourselves in                                     emotional moments lose their power once the emotion passes.                                     Great grief and joy may rouse us to action, but when the grief                                     or joy have passed, we’re no longer motivated to act.                                     Joy turns to grief in the blink of an eye, and grief becomes joy                                     just as quickly. This world is not made for either one to last                                     long in, and it’s no surprise that even our loves                                     change along with our luck. It’s still a mystery to                                     be solved whether luck controls love, or love controls luck.                                     When a great man has a run of bad luck, watch how followers                                     desert him, and when a poor man advances to an important                                     position, he makes friends with the people he used to hate. Love                                     is unreliable. A person with lots of money will always have                                     friends, while one fallen on hard times makes an enemy of any                                     friend he turns to for money. But back to my original                                     point—what we want and what we get are always at                                     odds. We can have our little dreams, but the fates decide our                                     futures. You think now you’ll never remarry, but that                                     thought will die with me, your first husband.']

['HAMLET', 'I know an angel who can read your mind. But okay, off to England!                                 Good-bye, dear mother.']
['CLAUDIUS', 'I’m your father, Hamlet—your father who                                 loves you.']
['HAMLET', 'You’re my mother. When you married my mother, the two                                 of you became one flesh, so if you’re my father                                 you’re also my mother. Come on, off to England!']
['CLAUDIUS', 'Follow him on foot, and get him on board as quickly as possible.                                 Don’t waste any time. I want him out of here tonight. Go                                 now; everything else is ready. Please hurry.']
['FORTINBRAS', 'Go, Captain, and give the Danish king my greetings. Tell him that                                 Fortinbras asks permission to move his troops across Denmark. You                                 know the meeting place we’ve arranged. If His Majesty                                 wants us to do any favor for him, tell him his wish is my                             command.']
['CAPTAIN', 'I’ll tell him, my lord.']
['FORTINBRAS', 'Go ahead, then.']
['HAMLET', 'Sir, whose troops are these?']
['CAPTAIN', 'The king of Norway’s, sir.']
['HAMLET', 'What are they doing here, sir?']
['CAPTAIN', 'They’re on their way to invade some part of                             Poland.']
['HAMLET', 'Who’s commanding them, sir?']
['CAPTAIN', 'The nephew of the old king of Norway, Fortinbras.']
['HAMLET', 'Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?']
['CAPTAIN', 'To tell the truth, we’re fighting to win a little patch                                 of ground that’s not worth anything. I myself                                 wouldn’t pay five ducats for it, if someone offered it to                                 me to farm. And it won’t provide any more profits than                                 that to either the Norwegian or the Pole.']
['HAMLET', 'So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.']
['CAPTAIN', 'Oh, yes they will. They’ve already stationed troops                                 there.']
['HAMLET', '(to himself) Even two thousand men                                 and twenty-thousand ducats are just the beginning of what it will                                 cost to settle this pointless matter. This is what happens when                                 countries have too much money and peace. This quarrel is like an                                 abcess that grows inside someone until it bursts and kills them, and                                 no one knows why. (to the CAPTAIN)                                 Thank you very much for the information, sir.']
['CAPTAIN', 'Good-bye, sir.']
['ROSENCRANTZ', 'Will you please come now, my lord?']
['HAMLET', 'I’ll be there in a minute. Start without me.']
['GERTRUDE', 'I won’t speak to her.']
['GENTLEMAN', 'She’s insistent. In fact, she’s crazed. You                                 can’t help feeling sorry for her.']
['GERTRUDE', 'What does she want?']
['GENTLEMAN', 'She talks about her father a lot, and says she hears there are                                 conspiracies around the world, and coughs, and beats her breast, and                                 gets angry over tiny matters, and talks nonsense. Her words                                 don’t mean anything, but her babbling causes her                                 listeners to draw conclusions. They hear what they want to hear. Her                                 winks and nods and gestures do suggest that she means to convey a                                 message, and not a happy one.']
['HORATIO', 'It’s a good idea to speak to her, since she might lead                                 those with evil intentions to dangerous conclusions.']
['GERTRUDE', 'Show her in.']
['OPHELIA', 'Where is the beautiful queen of Denmark?']
['GERTRUDE', 'What are you doing, Ophelia?']
['OPHELIA', ' (sings) ']
['GERTRUDE', 'Oh heavens, what does that song mean, my dear?']
['OPHELIA', 'I’m sorry, did you say something? Please just listen.']
['GERTRUDE', 'No, Ophelia—']
['OPHELIA', 'Just listen, please.']
['GERTRUDE', 'My lord, look at this poor girl.']
['OPHELIA', ' (sings) ']
