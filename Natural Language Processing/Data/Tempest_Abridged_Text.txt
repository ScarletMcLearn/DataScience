['MASTER', 'Boatswain!']
['BOATSWAIN', 'I’m here, sir. How can I help you?']
['MASTER', 'My good boy, give the other sailors a pep talk—and do                                 it fast, before we’re shipwrecked. Hurry, hurry!']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Come on, men! That’s the way to do it! Quickly!                                 Quickly! Take in the upper sail. Listen to the master’s                                 orders. —Blow your heart out, storm! So long as we have                                 enough room to avoid running aground!']
['ALONSO', 'Be careful, good Boatswain! Where’s the Master? Make                                 these men work.']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Please stay below deck, sir.']
['ANTONIO', 'Where’s the Master, Boatswain?']
['BOATSWAIN', 'He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?                                 You’re getting in the way of our work. Stay in your                                 cabins. You’re helping the storm, not us.']
['GONZALO', 'Don’t get wound up, my good man.']
['BOATSWAIN', 'I’m only wound up because the sea’s wound                                 up. Now get out of here! Do you think these waves care anything                                 about kings and officials? Go to your cabins and be quiet!                                 Don’t bother us up here.']
['GONZALO', 'Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good                                 man.']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Nobody I care about more than myself. You’re a                                 king’s advisor. If you can order the storm to calm down,                                 we can all put down our ropes and rest. Go ahead, use your                                 authority. If you can’t do it, be grateful                                 you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin,                                 if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out                                 of our way, I’m telling you.']
['GONZALO', 'I feel a lot better after talking to this guy. He                                 doesn’t look like a person who would drown—he                                 looks like he was born to be hangedGonzalo implies that the Boatswain looks and acts like a dangerous criminal.hanged. I hope he lives long enough to be hanged. The rope that                                 hangs him will do more good than all the ropes on this ship, since                                 it’ll guarantee he stays alive through this storm. But if                                 he’s not destined to die by hanging, then our chances                                 don’t look too good.']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Bring down that top sail! Fast! Lower, lower! Let the ship sail                                 close to the wind.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'Oh, go to hell, you loud-mouthed bastard!']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Well, get to work, then.']
['ANTONIO', 'Just die, you lowlife! Go ahead and die, you nasty, rude                                 bastard!You’re more scared of drowning than we                             are.']
['GONZALO', 'Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this                                 ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating                                 woman.']
['BOATSWAIN', 'Turn the ship to the wind! Set the sails and let her go out to sea                                 again!']
['SAILORS', 'It’s no use! Pray for your lives! We’re done                                 for!']
['BOATSWAIN', 'What, we’re going to die?']
['GONZALO', 'The king and the prince are praying. Let’s go join                                 them, since whatever happens to them happens to us too.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'I’m out of patience.']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, we’ve been cheated out of our lives by a bunch of                                 drunken, incompetent sailors. This bigmouth jerk                                 here—(to                                 BOATSWAIN) I hope you drown ten times                                 over!']
['GONZALO', 'He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every                                 drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.']
['VOICES', 'God have mercy on us!—The ship’s breaking                                 up!—Goodbye, wife and kids!—Goodbye,                                 brother!—We’re breaking up, we’re                                 breaking up!']
['ANTONIO', 'Let’s all sink with the king.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'Let’s say goodbye to him.']
['GONZALO', 'Right now I’d give a thousand furlongs1 furlong = 220 yardsfurlongs of sea for one little acre of dry ground: barren weed patch,                                 anything at all. What’s destined to happen will happen,                                 but I’d give anything to be dry when I die.']
['MIRANDA', 'Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic                                 powers, please put an end to it. The sky’s so dark it                                 looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea                                 weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out. Oh, I                                 suffered along with all the men I watched suffer! A fine ship, with                                 some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.                                 Their dying shouts broke my heart! The poor people died. If                                 I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink                                 inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and                                 all the people it was carrying.']
['PROSPERO', 'Calm down. There’s nothing to get upset about. No harm                                 was done.']
['MIRANDA', 'Oh, what a horrible day!']
['PROSPERO', 'There was no harm, I’m telling you. Everything                                 I’ve done has been for you, my dear daughter. You                                 don’t know what you are, since you don’t know                                 who I am or where I come from, or that I’m better than                                 merely Prospero, your humble father who lives in a poor little                                 shack.']
['MIRANDA', 'It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to                                 know.']
['PROSPERO', 'It’s time for you to know the whole story. Give me a                                 hand and help me off with this magic cloak.']
['MIRANDA', 'You’ve often started to tell me who I am, but then                                 suddenly stopped, leaving me asking questions that never get                                 answered, telling me, “Wait. Not yet.”']
['PROSPERO', 'Well, the time has come. This is the moment for you to listen hard                                 and pay close attention. Can you remember the time before you came                                 to live in this shack? I doubt it, since you weren’t even                                 three at the time.']
['MIRANDA', 'Sure I can, father.']
['PROSPERO', 'What do you remember? A house, a person? Tell me anything you                                 remember.']
['MIRANDA', 'My memory is hazy, more like a dream than a recollection.                                 Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of                                 me?']
['PROSPERO', 'Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda. But how is it possible                                 that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?                                 If you remember your life before you came here, you may also                                 remember how you got here.']
['MIRANDA', 'No, that I don’t remember.']
['PROSPERO', 'Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the                                 Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.']
['MIRANDA', 'Aren’t you my father?']
['PROSPERO', 'Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my                                 daughter. And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir,                                 a princess.']
['MIRANDA', 'Good lord! What evil things were done to us that we were driven                                 here? Or was it a blessing that we came here?']
['PROSPERO', 'Both, both, my girl. We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as                                 you call them. But we were blessed in being helped toward this                                 island.']
['MIRANDA', 'Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to                                 recall all this, things that I can’t remember. But please                                 tell me more.']
['PROSPERO', 'My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I                                 still can’t believe a brother could be so                                 disloyal!)—My brother whom—aside from                                 you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted                                 to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land,                                 and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my                                 education. Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic,                                 grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government                                 slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books. Your disloyal                                 uncle—are you paying attention?']
['MIRANDA', 'I’m hanging on every word.']
['PROSPERO', 'Once Antonio got the knack of granting certain requests, denying                                 others, promoting some officials and keeping down those who were                                 getting too ambitious, he won over the people who used to be mine,                                 or changed them—remade them, you might say. Since he had                                 control over the whole government and everyone in it, he soon made                                 everyone sing his own song—whichever song he happened to                                 like. He became like the ivy that sticks to the side of the tree,                                 and sucked my vitality out of me.—You’re not                                 paying attention.']
['MIRANDA', 'Oh, yes I am, father.']
['PROSPERO', 'Please listen to me carefully. As I neglected practical matters,                                 being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with                                 subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away                                 from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my                                 disloyal brother. My deep trust in him made him deeply                                 untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust                                 was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.                                 With Antonio possessing such powers and wealth, coming not only from                                 my income but also from his ability to take whatever my authority                                 allowed him to take, Antonio started to believe that he was the                                 duke, like some liar who begins to believe in his own lie. He put on                                 the face of royalty, with all the rights that go along with it. With                                 his ambition growing like this—do you hear what                                 I’m saying?']
['MIRANDA', 'What you’re saying could cure deafness, father. Of                                 course I hear it.']
['PROSPERO', 'To make his political performance absolutely perfect, he simply                                 had to become the Duke of Milan himself. My library was a large                                 enough dukedom for me. So, now Antonio judges me incapable of                                 carrying out my duties. He’s so power-hungry that he                                 allies himself with the King of Naples, agreeing to pay him a                                 regular annual sum, swear subservience to him, and put the dukedom                                 of Milan—never subservient to anyone                                 before!—under the humiliating control of Naples.']
['MIRANDA', 'Good heavens!']
['PROSPERO', 'Think about that, and about what followed afterward. Then tell me                                 if Antonio can be called a brother.']
['MIRANDA', 'It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother. Good                                 women sometimes give birth to bad sons.']
['PROSPERO', 'Now listen to the agreement they made. The king of Naples, my                                 arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was                                 that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him,                                 would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead. A                                 treacherous army was gathered, and one fateful night at midnight,                                 Antonio opened the gates of Milan, and in the pitch black had his                                 officers rush out me and you, my dear daughter. You were                             crying.']
['MIRANDA', 'How awful! I can’t remember how I cried then, but                                 I’ll cry all over again. This story breaks my                             heart.']
['PROSPERO', 'Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to                                 date about the present situation, which is the whole reason                                 I’m telling you this story in the first place.']
['MIRANDA', 'Why didn’t they just kill us that night?']
['PROSPERO', 'Good question, my girl. My story does raise that question. The                                 answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the                                 people of Milan loved me too much. The had to disguise their bloody                                 intentions. So, to make a long story short, they hurried us onto a                                 ship and carried us a number of miles out to sea, where they                                 prepared a rotten carcass of a boat, with no sails or masts or                                 ropes, which even the rats had abandoned. They tossed us in the                                 water to cry to the sea that roared back at us, to sigh into the                                 winds that sighed right back at us in pity.']
['MIRANDA', 'God, what a burden on you I must have been!']
['PROSPERO', 'No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going. You smiled                                 with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried                                 salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation. Your                                 smile sustained my spirits against whatever would come our                             way.']
['MIRANDA', 'How did we manage to get ashore?']
['PROSPERO', 'With God’s help. We had a little food and fresh water                                 that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the                                 kindness of his heart. He had been chosen to carry out the plan of                                 putting us to sea. He also gave us clothes, linen, and other                                 necessities that have been of great help. Knowing how much I loved                                 my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more                                 than my dukedom.']
['MIRANDA', 'I wish I could see that man someday!']
['PROSPERO', 'Now I’ll stand up.

Sometimes I appeared in many places at                                 once. On the top sail and main mast I flamed in different spots,                                 then I came together into a single flame. I flashed about faster                                 than lightning. The fire and deafening cracks seemed to overwhelm                                 even the god of the sea himself, making him tremble                             underwater.']

['SEBASTIAN', 'Sir, you can thank yourself for this great loss, because you                                 wouldn’t bless Europe with your daughter, but instead                                 pimped her out to an African. At least you can be thankful that she                                 won’t be around to remind you of your loss.']

['SEBASTIAN', 'We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and                                 your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an                                 African and the desire to obey you. Now I’m afraid                                 we’ve lost your son forever. Our shipwreck has made more                                 women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort                                 them. And it’s all your fault.']
['ALONSO', 'And the greatest sorrow is mine too.']
['GONZALO', 'My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of                                 saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time. You’re                                 rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying                             bandages.']

['SEBASTIAN', 'Bad times?']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, very bad.']
['GONZALO', 'If I could colonize this island, my lord—']
['ANTONIO', 'He’d cultivate weeds on it.']

['GONZALO', 'And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?']
['SEBASTIAN', 'He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no                                 wine here.']
['GONZALO', 'In my kingdom I’d do everything differently from the                                 way it’s usually done. I wouldn’t allow any                                 commerce. There’d be no officials or administrators.                                 There’d be no schooling or literature. There’d                                 be no riches, no poverty, and no servants—none. No                                 contracts or inheritance laws; no division of the land into private                                 farms, no metal-working, agriculture, or vineyards.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, he’s getting a bit confused.']
['GONZALO', 'Everything would be produced without labor, and would be shared by                                 all. There’d be no treason, crimes, or weapons. Nature                                 would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent                             people.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'There’d be no marriage?']
['ANTONIO', 'No. Everyone would have nothing to do. They’d all be                                 whores and slackers.']

['ANTONIO', 'Ouch, what a comeback!']
['SEBASTIAN', 'He sure did. Too bad it fell flat.']
['GONZALO', 'You’re brave gentlemen. You’d give the moon                                 a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.']

['GONZALO', 'I’m not. I’ve got good judgment, and I know                                 you’ve got nothing against me. Will you laugh me to                                 sleep? I’m feeling very sleepy.']
['ANTONIO', 'Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.']
['ALONSO', 'What, everybody falls asleep so fast? I wish I could sleep                                 too—it would stop me from thinking. Come to think of it,                                 I am feeling sleepy.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'In that case you should sleep. People in grief need a good sleep.                                 It doesn’t come to them often, but when it does come they                                 should enjoy it.']
['ANTONIO', 'The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep                                 you safe.']
['ALONSO', 'Thank you. I’m terribly sleepy.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'How strange that they all got so sleepy!']
['ANTONIO', 'There must be something in the air here.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'So why aren’t our eyelids heavy? I’m not                                 sleepy at all.']
['ANTONIO', 'Me neither. I’m wide awake. They all fell asleep                                 together, as if they’d planned it. Like they’d                                 all been struck by lightning. What might happen, Sebastian, what                                 might happen if—No, it’s time for me to shut                                 up.— But still, I think I can see in your face what you                                 ought to be. Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my                                 imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'Are you dreaming or awake?']
['ANTONIO', 'Don’t you hear me speaking?']
['SEBASTIAN', 'I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.                                 What did you say? It’s weird for you to be dreaming with                                 your eyes wide open—standing, talking, moving, but sound                                 asleep.']
['ANTONIO', 'Good Sebastian, you’re the one who’s                                 sleeping if you let this opportunity pass you by without acting on                                 it.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re                                 talking. There’s meaning in your snoring.']
['ANTONIO', 'I’m not kidding when I say this, I’m not                                 joking around like usual. You should be serious too when you listen                                 to what I’m saying. You can become a great man if you                                 listen to me.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'I’m hanging on every word you say.']
['ANTONIO', 'You need to do more than hang around—you have to act.                                 I’ll show you how.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'You need to. I’m lazy by nature.']
['ANTONIO', 'Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you                                 make fun of what I’m telling you! The more you joke about                                 it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is! Lazy people end up at                                 the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'Please, tell me more. There’s something in your                                 expression that tells me you have something serious to say, and                                 you’re having a lot of difficulty saying it.']
['ANTONIO', 'This is what I’m saying.

It’s as far from the truth                                 as saying this sleeping man is swimming.']
['SEBASTIAN', 'Yes, I’m sure he’s dead. I’ve got                                 no hope that he survived.']

And in the morning I’ll take you to your                                 ship and we’ll sail to Naples, where I hope to see this                                 loving couple married. After that I’ll retire to Milan,                                 where I’ll contemplate my death, which is soon to                             come.']
