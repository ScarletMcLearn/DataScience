['THESEUS', 'Our wedding day is almost here, my beautiful Hippolyta.                                 We’ll be getting married in four days, on the day of the                                 new moon. But it seems to me that the days are passing too                                 slowly—the old moon is taking too long to fade away! That                                 old, slow moon is keeping me from getting what I want, just like an                                 old widow makes her stepson wait to get his inheritance.']
['HIPPOLYTA', 'No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four                                 nights. And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then.                                 Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look                                 down on our wedding celebration.']
['THESEUS', 'Go, Philostrate, get the young people of Athens ready to celebrate                                 and have a good time. Sadness is only appropriate for funerals. We                                 don’t want it at our festivities.']
['EGEUS', 'Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!']
['THESEUS', 'Thanks, good Egeus. What’s new with you?']
['EGEUS', 'I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter                                 Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this                                 man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step                                 forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast                                 a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you,                                 Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of                                 love with my daughter. You’ve pretended to be in love                                 with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight,                                 and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks                                 of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents,                                 flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an                                 impressionable young person. You’ve connived to steal my                                 daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead                                 of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke,                                 if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask                                 you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.                                 Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as                                 the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or                                 have her killed.']
['THESEUS', 'What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia? Think carefully,                                 pretty girl. You should think of your father as a god, since                                 he’s the one who gave you your beauty. To him,                                 you’re like a figure that he’s sculpted out of                                 wax, and he has the power to keep that figure intact or to disfigure                                 it. Demetrius is an admirable man.']
['HERMIA', 'So is Lysander.']
['THESEUS', 'You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too. But                                 since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have                                 to consider Demetrius to be the better man.']
['HERMIA', 'I wish my father could see them with my eyes.']
['THESEUS', 'No, you must see them as your father sees them.']
['HERMIA', 'Your grace, please forgive me. I don’t know what makes                                 me think I can say this, and I don’t know if speaking my                                 mind to such a powerful and noble person as yourself will damage my                                 reputation for modesty. But please, tell me the worst thing that                                 could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.']
['THESEUS', 'You’ll either be executed or you’ll never                                 see another man again. So think carefully about what you want,                                 beautiful Hermia. Consider how young you are, and question your                                 feelings. Then decide whether you could stand to be a nun, wearing a                                 priestess’s habit and caged up in a cloister forever,                                 living your entire life without a husband or children, weakly                                 chanting hymns to the cold and virginal goddess of the moon. People                                 who can restrain their passions and stay virgins forever are holy.                                 But although a virgin priestess might be rewarded in heaven, a                                 married woman is happier on Earth. A married woman is like a rose                                 who is picked and made into a beautiful perfume, while a priestess                                 just withers away on the stem.']
['HERMIA', 'I’d rather wither away than give up my virginity to                                 someone I don’t love.']
['THESEUS', 'Take some time to think about this. By the time of the next new                                 moon—the day when Hippolyta and I will be                                 married—be ready either to be executed for disobeying                                 your father, to marry Demetrius as your father wishes, or to take a                                 vow to spend the rest of your life as a virgin priestess of the moon                                 goddess.']
['DEMETRIUS', 'Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting                                 like she’s yours. I’ve got more of a right to                                 her than you do.']
['LYSANDER', 'Her father loves you, Demetrius. So why don’t you marry                                 him and let me have Hermia?']
['EGEUS', 'It’s true, rude Lysander, I do love him.                                 That’s why I’m giving him my daughter.                                 She’s mine, and I’m giving her to                             Demetrius.']
['LYSANDER', ' (to                                 THESEUS) My lord, I’m just                                 as noble and rich as he is. I love Hermia more than he does. My                                 prospects are as good as his, if not better. And beautiful Hermia                                 loves me—which is more important than all those other                                 things I’m bragging about. Why shouldn’t I be                                 able to marry her? Demetrius—and I’ll say this                                 to his face—courted Nedar’s daughter, Helena,                                 and made her fall in love with him. That sweet lady, Helena, loves                                 devoutly. She adores this horrible and unfaithful man.']
['THESEUS', 'I have to admit I’ve heard something about that, and                                 meant to ask Demetrius about it, but I was too busy with personal                                 matters and it slipped my mind.—Anyway, Demetrius and                                 Egeus, both of you, come with me. I want to say a few things to you                                 in private.—As for you, beautiful Hermia, get ready to do                                 what your father wants, because otherwise the law says that you must                                 die or become a nun, and there’s nothing I can do about                                 that.—Come with me, Hippolyta. How are you, my                                 love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us. I want you to do                                 some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something                                 that concerns you both.']
['EGEUS', 'We’re following you not only because it is our duty,                                 but also because we want to.']
['LYSANDER', 'What’s going on, my love? Why are you so pale? Why have                                 your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?']
['HERMIA', "Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I                                 could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes."]
['LYSANDER', 'Oh, honey! Listen, in books they say that true love always faces                                 obstacles. Either the lovers have different social                                 standings—']
['HERMIA', 'Oh, what an obstacle that would be! Imagine being too high on the                                 social ladder, and falling in love with someone beneath you.']
['LYSANDER', 'Or else they were very different ages—']
['HERMIA', 'How awful! Being too old to marry someone young.']
['LYSANDER', 'Or else their guardians and advisors said no—']
['HERMIA', 'What hell, to have your love life determined by someone                             else!']
['LYSANDER', 'Or, even if the lovers are a good match, their love might be                                 ruined by war, death, or sickness, so that the affair only lasts an                                 instant. Their time together might be as fleeting as a shadow or as                                 short as a dream, lasting only as long as it takes a lightning bolt                                 to flash across the sky. Before you can say                                 “look,” it’s gone.                                 That’s how intense things like love are quickly                                 destroyed.']
['HERMIA', 'If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of                                 fate. So let’s try to be patient as we deal with our                                 problem. It’s as normal a part of love as dreams, sighs,                                 wishes, and tears.']
['LYSANDER', 'That’s the right attitude. So, listen, Hermia. I have                                 an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and                                 doesn’t have any children. She lives about twenty miles                                 from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son. I could marry you there,                                 gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t                                 touch us. So here’s the plan. If you love me, sneak out of your father’s house tomorrow night and meet me                                 in the forest a few miles outside of town.                              ']
['HERMIA', 'Oh, Lysander, I swear I’ll be there tomorrow. I swear                                 by Cupid’s strongest bow and his best gold-tipped arrow,                                 by the Goddess of Love’s innocent doves, by everything                                 that ties lovers together, by the bonfire where Queen Dido burned                                 herself to death when her lover Aeneas jilted her, and by all the                                 promises that men have broken (and men have broken more promises                                 than women have ever made). I give you my word, I will meet you at                                 that spot tomorrow.']
['LYSANDER', 'Keep your promise, my love. Look, here comes Helena.']
['HERMIA', 'Hello, beautiful Helena! Where are you going?']
['HELENA', 'Did you just call me “beautiful”? Take it                                 back. You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is                                 concerned. Oh, you’re so lucky! Your eyes are like stars,                                 and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a                                 shepherd in the springtime. Sickness is contagious—I wish                                 beauty were contagious too! I would catch your good looks before I                                 left. My ear would be infected by your voice, my eye by your eye,                                 and my tongue would come down with a bad case of your melodious                                 speech. If the world were mine, I’d give it all                                 up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. ']
['HERMIA', 'I frown at him, but he still loves me.']
['HELENA', 'Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your                                 frowns!']
['HERMIA', 'I curse him, but he loves me.']
['HELENA', 'If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!']
['HERMIA', 'The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.']
['HELENA', 'The more I love him, the more he hates me.']
['HERMIA', 'It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.']
['HELENA', 'That’s true, it’s your beauty’s                                 fault. I wish I had a fault like that!']
['HERMIA', 'Don’t worry. He won’t see my face ever                                 again. Lysander and I are running away from here. Before I saw                                 Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me. But                                 Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned                                 heaven into hell!']
['LYSANDER', 'Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan. Tomorrow                                 night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass                                 with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides                                 runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.']
['HERMIA', ' (to                                 HELENA) In the woods where you and I                                 used to lounge around on the pale primroses, telling each other                                 sweet secrets—that’s where Lysander and I will                                 meet.']
['LYSANDER', 'I will, my Hermia.']
['HELENA', 'It’s amazing how much happier some people are than                                 others! People throughout Athens think I’m as beautiful                                 as Hermia. But so what? Demetrius doesn’t think so, and                                 that’s all that matters. He refuses to admit what                                 everyone else knows. But even though he’s making a                                 mistake by obsessing over Hermia so much, I’m also making                                 a mistake, since I obsess over him. Love can make worthless things                                 beautiful. When we’re in love, we don’t see                                 with our eyes but with our minds. That’s why paintings of                                 Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind. And love                                 doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has                                 wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and                                 hasty. That’s why they say love is a child. because it                                 makes such bad choices. Just as boys like to play games by telling                                 lies, Cupid breaks his promises all the time. Before Demetrius ever                                 saw Hermia, he showered me with promises and swore he’d                                 be mine forever.']
['QUINCE', 'Is everyone here?']
['BOTTOM', 'You should call their names generally,Bottom means “individually,” not “generally. Bottom frequently makes mistakes with words.generally, one person at a time, in the order in which their names                                 appear on this piece of paper.']
['QUINCE', 'This is a list of the names of all the men in Athens who are good                                 enough to act in the play we’re going to perform for the                                 duke and duchess on their wedding night.']

We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in                                 the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or                                 on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us. And because you                                 interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds                                 have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so                                 that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you. So all the work                                 that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for                                 nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.                                 Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the                                 crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep. All the                                 fields where people usually play games are filled with mud, and you                                 can’t even see the elaborate mazes that people create in                                 the grass, because no one walks in them anymore and                                 they’ve all grown over.

So the pale, angry                                 moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases. As a                                 consequence of this bad weather and these bad moods the seasons have                                 started to change. Cold frosts spread over the red roses, and the                                 icy winter wears a crown of sweet summer flowers as some sick joke.                                 Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed                                 places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is                                 which.

We used to                                 laugh to see the sails fill up with wind so that they looked like                                 they had big, pregnant bellies, as if the wind had gotten them                                 pregnant.

But                                 since she was a mortal, she died giving birth to that boy, and for                                 her sake I’m raising him and will not give him up.']

(to ROBIN                                 GOODFELLOW) My dear Puck, come here.                                 You remember the time when I was sitting on a cliff, and I heard a                                 mermaid sitting on a dolphin’s back sing such a sweet and                                 harmonious song that it calmed the stormy sea and made stars shoot                                 out of the sky so they could hear her better?']
['ROBIN', 'Yes, I remember.']
['OBERON', 'That same night, I saw Cupid flying from the moon to the earth,                                 with all of his arrows ready. (You couldn’t see him, but                                 I could.) He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on                                 a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of                                 love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts. But I                                 could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery,                                 virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal                                 thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love. But I paid                                 attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell. It fell on a                                 little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has                                 turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love. Young girls                                 call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that                                 flower. I showed it to you once. If its juice is put on                                 someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that                                 person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she                                 sees. Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster                                 has time to swim three miles.']

She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing                                 she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a                                 lion, a bear, a wolf, a bull, a monkey, or an ape. And before I make                                 her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with                                 another plant—I’ll make her give me that                                 little boy as my page.

I am a                                 man, just like other men.” And then he should say his                                 name, and tell them plainly that he’s Snug the                             carpenter.']

But                                 there’s still another problem: we need to have a wall in                                 the big hall, because according to the story, Pyramus and Thisbe                                 talked through a little hole in a wall.']
['SNOUT', 'You’ll never be able to bring in a wall. What do you                                 think, Bottom?']

She said yes right                                 away, and sent a fairy to bring him to my home in Fairyland. And now                                 that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her                                 vision so disgustingly wrong.

Lovers and                                 madmen hallucinate about things that sane people just                                 can’t understand. Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are                                 ruled by their overactive imaginations. some people think they see                                 devils and monsters everywhere—and they’re                                 lunatics. Lovers are just as crazy, and think a dark-skinned gypsy                                 is the most gorgeous woman in the world. Poets are always looking                                 around like they’re having a fit, confusing the mundane                                 with the otherworldly, and describing things in their writing that                                 simply don’t exist. All these people have such strong                                 imaginations that, when they feel happy, they assume a god or some                                 other supernatural being is bringing that happiness to them. Or if                                 they’re afraid of something at night, they look at the                                 shrubbery and imagine it’s a wild bear!']
['HIPPOLYTA', 'But the story that these lovers are telling, and the fact that                                 they all saw and heard exactly the same things, make me think                                 there’s more going on here than imaginary fantasies.

In the entire play, not one word is                                 well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.

In my travels, great scholars have come up to me,                                 meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I                                 have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in                                 the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones                                 of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off                                 abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me. Trust me, my                                 sweet, I figured out that they were trying to welcome me even though                                 they were silent, and that message was as clear from someone who was                                 modest and nervously dutiful as it is from someone who is loud and                                 audacious and eloquent. Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity                                 can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in                                 my opinion.']

['PROLOGUE', ' (delivered by                                 QUINCE) Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps                                 you are wondering what is going on. Well, keep wondering, until the                                 truth makes everything clear. This man is Pyramus, if you want to                                 know. This beautiful lady is definitely Thisbe. This man with the                                 limestone and cement is portraying Wall, that horrible wall that                                 kept these lovers apart. They are content to whisper through                                 Wall’s little hole, the poor souls, and no one should be                                 surprised. This man, with his lantern, dog, and thornbush, portrays                                 Moonshine, because, if you want to know, the lovers were not ashamed                                 to meet each other by moonshine at Ninus’s tomb in order                                 to carry on their courtship. This grisly beast, which is called                                 “Lion,” scared away, or rather frightened, the                                 faithful Thisbe when she arrived at the meeting place at night. As                                 she ran away from him, she dropped her cloak, which the horrible                                 Lion stained with his bloody mouth. Soon Pyramus comes along, a tall                                 and handsome young man, and finds his faithful Thisbe’s                                 cloak to be dead. At this point, he takes his sword, his bloody                                 blameful blade, and bravely breaks open his boiling bloody breast.                                 And Thisbe, hiding in the shade of the mulberry bushes, took his                                 dagger and killed herself. For the rest of the story, let Lion,                                 Moonshine, Wall, and the two lovers talk more about it, since                                 they’re standing here.']
