All I’m saying is that                                 strange things have been going on. Macbeth pitied                                 Duncan—after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out                                 walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must                                 have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime.                                 Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help                                 thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill                                 their gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it                                 saddened                                 MacbethLennox speaks sarcastically throughout this speech, making it clear that he thinks Macbeth is guilty of the murders.Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill those two                                 servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That                                 was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the                                 wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear                                 those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth                                 has handled things well. If he had Duncan’s sons in                                 prison—which I hope won’t                                 happen—they would find out how awful the punishment is                                 for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough                                 of that. I hear that Macduff is out of favor with the king because                                 he speaks his mind too plainly, and because he failed to show up at                                 Macbeth’s feast.
