['LEONATO', ' (holding a letter) According to                                 this letter, Don“Don” is the Italian equivalent of “Sir” or “Lord.”Don Pedro of Aragon and his army are coming to Messina                             tonight.']
['MESSENGER', 'He must be very near by now. When I left him, he was less than                                 nine miles from here.']
['LEONATO', 'How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just                             fought?']
['MESSENGER', 'Not many, and no one important.']
['LEONATO', 'A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers                                 return home safely. This letter also says that Don Pedro has given                                 honors to a young man from Florence named Claudio.']
['MESSENGER', 'Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him                                 accordingly. Claudio has done more than anyone would expect of a man                                 his age. He looks like a lamb but fights like a lion. He has so                                 greatly exceeded all expectations that I can’t even                                 describe all he’s done.']
['LEONATO', 'He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this                                 news.']
['MESSENGER', 'I have delivered some letters to his uncle, and he seemed very                                 happy. He got so emotional that he actually looked like he was in                                 pain.']
['LEONATO', 'Did he start weeping?']
['MESSENGER', 'Yes, heavily.']
['LEONATO', 'That’s a very natural display of affection.                                 There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.                                 And it’s definitely better to cry because                                 you’re happy than laugh because you’re                             sad!']
['BEATRICE', 'Please tell me, has Signior Montanto“Montanto” is a fencing term for an upward thrust.Montanto returned from battle?']
['MESSENGER', "I don’t know anyone with that name, ma'am.                                 There was no Signior Montanto in our army."]
['LEONATO', 'Who are you talking about, niece?']
['HERO', 'My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.']
['MESSENGER', 'Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.']
['BEATRICE', ' BenedickThe exact meaning of this story is unclear, but it depicts Benedick as a braggart and a fool.Benedick once put up a public notice in Messina challenging Cupid to                                 an archery match. My uncle’s jester accepted the contest                                 on Cupid’s behalf but used toy arrows at the shooting                                 match. But tell me, how many men did he kill and eat in this battle?                                 I promised him I would eat anyone he killed.']
['LEONATO', 'For God’s sake, Beatrice, you’re criticizing                                 Signior Benedick too heavily. But I’m sure                                 he’ll get even with you.']
['MESSENGER', 'Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.']
['BEATRICE', 'You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it. He’s a                                 very brave eater—he has a strong stomach.']
['MESSENGER', 'He’s a good soldier too, lady.']
['BEATRICE', 'He’s a good soldier to a lady? Well then, what is he to                                 a lord?']
['MESSENGER', 'He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man. He is                                 positively stuffed with honorable virtues.']
['BEATRICE', 'Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy. As for what                                 he’s stuffed with—well, nobody’s                                 perfect.']
['LEONATO', 'Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir. Benedick                                 and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.                                 Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle.']
['BEATRICE', 'And I always win. The last time we fought, he was so dazed by the                                 end that he wasn’t much smarter than his horse. So tell                                 me, who is he hanging around with these days? Every month he has a                                 new best friend.']
['MESSENGER', 'Is that possible?']
['BEATRICE', 'It’s entirely possible. He’s incredibly                                 fickle—his affection changes faster than the latest                                 fashions.']
['MESSENGER', 'I can see you don’t like this gentleman.']
['BEATRICE', 'No, absolutely not. But please tell me, who’s his best                                 friend? Isn’t there some new swaggering young ruffian who                                 will happily go to hell with Benedick?']
['MESSENGER', 'He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.']
['BEATRICE', 'Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease! Benedick is an                                 infection that’s easy to catch but hard to get rid                                 of—and he’ll drive you crazy once                                 you’ve been infected. God help Claudio! If                                 he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his                                 money before he’s cured.']
['MESSENGER', 'I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side,                             lady.']
['BEATRICE', 'Do that, my friend.']
['LEONATO', 'You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my                                 niece.']
['BEATRICE', 'No, not until we see a hot January.']
['MESSENGER', 'Don Pedro is here.']
['DON PEDRO', 'My dear Signior Leonato, hosting my whole army is such a huge                                 burden, but you accept it—and me—with open                                 arms. Most people choose to avoid trouble, but you run to it.']
['LEONATO', 'You are never trouble to this house, your Grace. It’s                                 comforting when trouble departs. But when                                 you leave, you take happiness with                                 you and leave sorrow in its place.']
['DON PEDRO', 'You take up your duties too cheerfully.                                 (turning to                                 HERO) This must be your                             daughter.']
['LEONATO', 'That’s what her mother always tells me.']
['BENEDICK', 'Did you doubt that she was your daughter, since you had to ask her                                 mother?']
['LEONATO', ' (teasing) Of course not, Signior                                 Benedick. You were only a child when my daughter was born, and not                                 yet old enough to seduce my wife.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Ah, he got you back, Benedick! Leonato clearly knows your                                 reputation with women. Seriously, though, the lady resembles Leonato                                 so much that there can be no doubt about who her father is.                                 Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.']
['BENEDICK', 'Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she                                 wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her                                 shoulders!']
['BEATRICE', 'I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior                                 Benedick. No one’s listening to you.']
['BENEDICK', 'Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain! Aren’t you                                 dead yet?']
['BEATRICE', 'How could disdain die when you’re here? When                                 you’re around, even Lady Courtesy becomes Lady                             Disdain.']
['BENEDICK', 'That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor. All ladies love me, except                                 you. It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because                                 I really don’t love anyone.']
['BEATRICE', 'Women are lucky, then. You would make a nasty suitor. Thankfully,                                 I feel the same way you do. I have no need for romance. I would                                 rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he                                 loves me.']
['BENEDICK', 'Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will                                 end up with his face all scratched up.']
['BEATRICE', 'If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t                                 make him look any worse.']
['BENEDICK', 'Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.']
['BEATRICE', 'I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like                             you.']
['BENEDICK', 'I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.                                 That’s it—I’m done.']
['BEATRICE', 'You always slip out of the argument like this. I know you from                                 before.']
['DON PEDRO', 'And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio,                                 Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to                                 stay here at Messina. I told him we’ll stay for at least                                 a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer. I                                 think he’s actually serious, and not just being                             polite.']
['LEONATO', 'I am being serious, my lord. (to                                 DON JOHN) I welcome you here as well.                                 Now that you and your brother have made friends again, I owe you the                                 same allegiance I owe Don Pedro.']
['DON JOHN', 'Thank you. I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank                                 you.']
['LEONATO', 'If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all                             inside?']
['DON PEDRO', 'Give me your hand, Leonato. We will go in together.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s                             daughter?']
['BENEDICK', 'I saw her, but I didn’t notice her.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?']
['BENEDICK', 'Do you want my true opinion? Or do you want me to criticize her                                 like I do all women?']
['CLAUDIO', 'No, please, speak seriously.']
['BENEDICK', 'Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly,                                 too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly.                                 I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she                                 does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything                                 but herself, I don’t like her.']
['CLAUDIO', 'You think I’m kidding. Please tell me seriously what                                 you think of her.']
['BENEDICK', 'Are you thinking of buying her? Is that why you’re                                 asking?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Would it even be possible to buy a jewel as rare and precious as                                 Hero?']
['BENEDICK', 'Yes, and you could buy a case to put it in, too. But tell me, are                                 you speaking seriously? Or are you just teasing? If I’m                                 going to sing along with you, I need to know what key                                 you’re singing in.']
['CLAUDIO', 'I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve                                 ever laid eyes on.']
['BENEDICK', 'I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I                                 don’t see what you’re talking about. If her                                 cousin Beatrice didn’t have such a nasty temper,                                 she’d be so much more beautiful than Hero that it would                                 be like comparing May to December. But, hey, this doesn’t                                 mean you’re looking to get married, does it?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust                                 myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.']
['BENEDICK', 'What’s going on these days? Isn’t there one                                 man left in the world who knows not to take a wife? She’s                                 just going to cheat on him. Will I never see a sixty-year old                                 bachelor again or will all men be swindled into marriage while                                 they’re young? Go ahead, then, if you have to yoke                                 yourself to marriage, like an ox carrying his load, and throw away                                 your free time. Look, Don Pedro has come back for you.']
['DON PEDRO', 'What secrets between you have kept you from following us to                                 Leonato’s?']
['BENEDICK', 'Your highness will have to force me to tell.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Your loyalty to me requires you to tell me what you’ve                                 been talking about.']
['BENEDICK', 'Look, Claudio, I can keep secrets like a mute; I want you to know                                 that. But I owe Don Pedro my allegiance—look, I                                 have to tell                                 him—(to DON                                 PEDRO) Claudio is in love. With whom?                                 That’s what you’re supposed to ask me next,                                 your Grace. Look how short the answer is—with Hero,                                 Leonato’s short daughter.']
['CLAUDIO', 'If you say so.']
['BENEDICK', 'Listen to him deny it, like that man in the old tale                                 “Mr. Fox”: “It isn’t                                 true and wasn’t true and God forbid it should be                                 so.”']
['CLAUDIO', 'Unless my feelings change very soon, I have to admit                                 it’s true.']
['DON PEDRO', 'It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s                                 worthy of your love.']
['CLAUDIO', 'You’re trying to trick me, my lord.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think.']
['CLAUDIO', 'And I swear I spoke honestly to Benedick—I am in love                                 with Hero.']
['BENEDICK', 'And I swear all up and down I spoke                                 honestly when I said that this was a horrible idea.']
['CLAUDIO', 'I feel that I love her.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I know that she is worthy of that love.']
['BENEDICK', 'I, on the other hand, don’t                                 feel how she could be loved and                                 don’t know how she could                                 be worthy. Even fire can’t melt that opinion out of me.                                 You could burn me at the stake, and I’d still think                             this.']
['DON PEDRO', 'You never did believe in the power of beauty.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Or in the power of reason.']
['BENEDICK', 'I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her                                 effort. And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too.                                 But all the other women will have to forgive me for not being                                 willing to be made a fool of—cheated on by a wife. I                                 don’t want to insult any particular woman by doubting and                                 mistrusting her, so I’ll just avoid them all. And the                                 conclusion of this is that I’ll live as a                                 bachelor—and, with the money I save, dress better.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with                                 love.']
['BENEDICK', 'With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never                                 sick with love.

['DON PEDRO', 'I’ll be sure to remember this fuss you’ve                                 made, in case you ever do fall in love. That’ll be                             news.']
['BENEDICK', 'If I ever change my mind, you can use me for target practice. And                                 whoever hits the bull’s eye gets to be a hero.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Well, time will tell. Even the most savage bull is eventually                                 domesticated.']
['BENEDICK', 'Maybe the bull is, but if I am ever                                 domesticated, you can take that bull’s horns and put them                                 right on my forehead, as my wife is sure to cuckold me soon enough.                                 You might as well hang a big sign with enormous lettering around my                                 neck. But instead of it saying “Horse for                                 hire,” it will say “Take a look at Benedick,                                 the married man.”']
['CLAUDIO', 'If that ever happened, you’d go absolutely mad.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Well, if Cupid hasn’t used up all his arrows in Venice,                                 where the courtesans are famous for making men lovesick,                                 he’ll get you to quiver and shake. Just you wait.']
['BENEDICK', 'That’s about as likely as an earthquake.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Oh, you’ll soften as time passes. While                                 you’re waiting for that to happen, though, hurry to                                 Leonato’s. Give him my respects, and tell him                                 I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has                                 gone to great lengths for this meal.']
['BENEDICK', 'I think I can handle this mission. And so I commit                             you—']
['CLAUDIO', '“Into God’s hands. From my house, if I had a                                 house—”']

['BENEDICK', 'Oh, stop joking around. You know, sometimes you two dress up your                                 conversation with flimsy little bits of wit that don’t                                 hold together too well. Before you make funBenedick and Claudio are making fun of the fact that “I commit you” is, in Shakespeare’s time, a common way to end a formal letter.fun of everyone else, look at yourselves in the mirror! And with                                 that, I’m leaving.']
['CLAUDIO', 'My lord, you could really help me out now.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I am at your service. Just tell me what you want me to do, and                                 however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager                                 to do it.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Does Leonato have a son, my lord?']
['DON PEDRO', 'Hero is his only child, and his only heir. Do you like her,                                 Claudio?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Oh, my lord, when we left Messina to fight the war, I looked at                                 Hero with the eyes of a soldier. I liked what I saw, but my mind was                                 so occupied with the rough, violent task ahead of me that there was                                 no chance that like would turn                                 intolove. But now that I’m                                 back, the room in my head that I used to fill with war plans has                                 become crowded with soft and delicate feelings. They all lead me to                                 the same thought—how beautiful young Hero is and how I                                 must have liked her even before I left to fight.']
['DON PEDRO', 'You will become a true lover soon, and exhaust your friends with                                 your endless chatter about your feelings. Look, if you really love                                 the beautiful Hero, enjoy it. I will speak to her and her father                                 about the matter, and I’ll convince Leonato to promise                                 Hero to you. Isn’t that the reason you told me all                             this?']
['CLAUDIO', 'You can see that I’m sick with love, and                                 you’re taking care of me in just the right way! But I                                 didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my                                 emotions. I was going to explain my feelings with a longer                             story.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Why speak longer than you have to? That’s like building                                 a bridge wider than the river it crosses. Whatever gets the job done                                 is best. You love Hero; that’s all I need to know to want                                 to find a remedy. They’re going to have a costume party                                 with dancing tonight. I’ll disguise myself as you and                                 pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her                                 prisoner with the force of my love story. Then I’ll talk                                 to her father. And in the end, she’s yours!                                 Let’s get started right away.']
['LEONATO', 'Hey, brother. Tell me, where is my nephew, your son? Has he taken                                 care of the music?']
['ANTONIO', 'He is taking care of it as we speak. But brother, I have some                                 strange news for you.']
['LEONATO', 'Is it good news?']
['ANTONIO', 'Well, it seems like good news. A servant of mine overheard the                                 Prince and Claudio talking as they walked through my orchard. The                                 Prince said that he is in love with Hero, your daughter, and that he                                 is going to tell her so at the dance tonight. If he she wants to                                 marry him, too, he’s going to find you and ask for her                                 hand immediately.']
['LEONATO', 'Is this servant of yours a smart man?']
['ANTONIO', 'He’s very bright. I’ll get him to come here,                                 and you can ask him yourself.']
['LEONATO', 'No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a                                 dream we had. But my daughter should know about this, so she can be                                 prepared with an answer just in case. Go to her and tell her for                             me.']
['CONRAD', 'Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?']
['DON JOHN', 'The things that cause my sadness are without limit. Therefore my                                 sadness is without limit.']
['CONRAD', 'You should listen to reason. Then you’d stop being so                                 gloomy.']
['DON JOHN', 'And after I have sat and listened to reason, what’s my                                 prize?']
['CONRAD', 'If not an end to your suffering, then at least you’ll                                 have the means to endure it patiently.']
['DON JOHN', 'I’m amazed that you—being such a moody man                                 yourself—are moralizing about my deadly condition. I                                 can’t hide what I am. I’ll be sad when I have                                 reason to be sad and won’t smile at anybody’s                                 jokes. I’ll eat when I’m hungry and                                 won’t wait until it’s convenient.                                 I’ll sleep when I’m tired and won’t                                 rouse myself for anything. I’ll laugh when I’m                                 happy and won’t flatter and fawn over anyone.']
['CONRAD', 'Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until                                 there’s no danger in it. Not long ago you challenged and                                 opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has                                 forgiven you. You need to act carefully if you’re going                                 to stay in his good graces. You have to wait for the appropriate                                 time to let loose.']
['DON JOHN', 'I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my                                 brother’s garden. It suits me more to be hated by                                 everyone than to put on a fancy show and trick people into loving                                 me. Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can                                 say that I am honest about being a villain. My brother trusts me                                 now? Yeah—as much as a master trusts the dog he muzzles                                 or the peasant he “frees” by chaining a big                                 block around the man’s foot. If my mouth were                                 unrestrained, I’d bite. If I were free, I’d do                                 what I pleased. Until that happens, let me be who I am and                                 don’t try to change me.']

['DON JOHN', 'I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.                                 Who’s that?']
['BORACHIO', 'I just came from a great feast where Leonato is entertaining the                                 Prince, your brother. I can give you information about an intended                                 marriage.']
['DON JOHN', 'Will this give me an opportunity to make some mischief? Who is                                 this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage?']

['DON JOHN', 'Who? That pretty boy, Claudio?']
['BORACHIO', 'That’s the one.']
['DON JOHN', 'He’s a very fancy gentleman. And who’s the                                 girl who has caught his eye?']
['BORACHIO', 'Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.']
['DON JOHN', 'A lively young one! How did you learn about this?']
['BORACHIO', 'I was hired to perfume all the rooms in Leonato’s                                 house. As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio                                 entered. They were in the middle of a serious conversation. I                                 quickly hid behind a tapestry and heard them agree that the Prince                                 would court Hero tonight at the dance and, once he won her consent                                 to marry, would give her to Claudio.']
['DON JOHN', 'Come, let’s go to the dance. This just may cheer me up.                                 Claudio, the young upstart, was responsible for keeping me from                                 gaining power over my brother. If there’s any way I can                                 spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed. You’ll both                                 help me, right?']
['CONRAD', 'Until the day we die, my lord.']
['DON JOHN', 'Let’s go to this great feast. They’ll be                                 even happier now that my mood has lightened. It’s too bad                                 the cook doesn’t think like me; she would have poisoned                                 them all if she did. Should we go check out the scene?']
['BORACHIO', 'Lead the way, sir.']
['LEONATO', 'Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?']
['ANTONIO', 'I didn’t see him.']
['BEATRICE', 'That man always looks so sour! Just looking at him gives me                                 heartburn.']
['HERO', 'He has a very gloomy attitude.']
['BEATRICE', 'It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don                                 John and Benedick. One of them is too much like a painting of a                                 man—he never speaks—and the other is too much                                 like a spoiled little boy, always chattering.']
['LEONATO', 'So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as                                 serious as Don John—']
['BEATRICE', 'And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any                                 woman in the world—all he’d need was her good                                 will.']
['LEONATO', 'Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep                                 saying such harsh things about people.']
['ANTONIO', 'Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.']
['BEATRICE', 'Being “too ill-tempered” is different from                                 being simply “ill-tempered,” right? So I                                 suppose that means I can escape God’s punishment, for in                                 the old proverb, it is said that “God gives an                                 ill-tempered cow short horns” so that she                                 can’t inflict damage on anyone. But it doesn’t                                 say anything about a cow that is too                                 ill-tempered.']
['LEONATO', 'So then, for being too argumentative, God won’t send                                 you any horns?']
['BEATRICE', ' ExactlyBy saying God won’t give horns, Beatrice jokes that she won’t have a husband.Exactly. I pray every morning and night that the Lord                                 won’t send me a husband. Really, I couldn’t                                 stand a husband with a beard. I’d rather be wrapped in                                 scratchy blankets all night. ']
['LEONATO', 'Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.']
['BEATRICE', 'And then what would I do with him? Dress him up in my clothes and                                 pretend he’s my lady servant? If he has a beard,                                 he’s more than a boy; if he doesn’t have a                                 beard, he’s less than a man. If he’s more than                                 a boy, he’s not the one for me, and if he’s                                 less than a man, I’m not the one for him. They say that                                 women who die unmarried are destined to lead the apes to hell, and I                                 suppose that’ll be my fate as well.']
['LEONATO', 'So you’ll go to hell?']
['BEATRICE', 'No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with                                 the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to                                 heaven, Beatrice. Hell is no place for you virgins.” So                                 I’ll fly up to heaven (leaving the apes behind) where                                 I’ll be met by Saint Peter guarding heaven’s                                 gates. He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit,                                 and I’ll have fun there forever.']
['ANTONIO', ' (to                                 HERO) Well, niece, I trust that you                                 will defer to your father on these important decisions.']
['BEATRICE', 'Surely, my cousin has a duty to please her father. But if the                                 husband her father chooses isn’t handsome, she should                                 sweetly tell her father that she will please herself—with                                 another one.']
['LEONATO', 'Well, niece, I hope that I will see you married one day.']
['BEATRICE', 'No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of                                 something other than dirt.

But please, forgive                                 me, your highness. I was born to speak cleverly, not                             seriously.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I’d be more offended if you were silent, for being                                 lively and cheerful suits you best. Surely, you must have been born                                 at a happy time.']
['BEATRICE', 'Actually, my lord, my mother cried when she was giving birth to                                 me. But then a star danced in the sky, and that’s the                                 moment I was born.—Kinsmen, I’m off.']
['LEONATO', 'Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?']
['BEATRICE', 'Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If                                 you’ll excuse me, your grace.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.']
['LEONATO', 'There’s very little about her that’s gloomy,                                 my lord. She’s only sad when she sleeps—and                                 not even then. Hero told me that Beatrice has often had dreams about                                 being unhappy, and managed to wake herself from them by                             laughing.']
['DON PEDRO', 'She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.']
['LEONATO', 'No, not at all. She mocks all her suitors so severely that they                                 drop the suit.']
['DON PEDRO', 'She would make a good wife for Benedick.']
['LEONATO', 'Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves                                 crazy within a week.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be                             married?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Tomorrow, my lord. Time will move as slowly as an old man until                                 our love receives its proper ceremony.']
['LEONATO', 'Wait till Monday, my dear son, which is only a week away. Even                                 that is too short a time to plan things the way I would like.']
['DON PEDRO', ' (to                                 CLAUDIO) Oh, don’t look so                                 frustrated at having to wait so long. I promise you, Claudio, the                                 time will go by quickly. While we’re waiting for the                                 wedding, I’m going to take on an impossible task: to make                                 Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice fall in love with each other.                                 I aim to see them matched, and with all of your help, I’m                                 sure we can make it happen.']
['LEONATO', 'My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake                                 for ten nights straight.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Me too, my lord.']
['DON PEDRO', 'And you, sweet Hero?']
['HERO', 'I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin                                 get a good husband.']
['DON PEDRO', 'And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of. This much I                                 can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in                                 battle, and has established his good character. Hero,                                 I’ll show you how to influence your cousin so she falls                                 in love with Benedick. We men will trick Benedick so that, despite                                 his quick wit and his queasiness about marriage, he will fall in                                 love with her. If we can do this, then we will steal                                 Cupid’s glory. We will be the supreme love gods! Come                                 inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.']
['DON JOHN', 'It’s arranged. The Count Claudio will marry                                 Leonato’s daughter.']
['BORACHIO', 'Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.']
['DON JOHN', 'Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be                                 like medicine to me. I hate him so much it makes me sick, and                                 whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy. How will you                                 wreck this marriage?']
['BORACHIO', 'I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly                                 that no one will suspect me.']
['DON JOHN', 'Quickly, tell me how.']
['BORACHIO', 'I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret,                                 Hero’s servant woman, likes me.']
['DON JOHN', 'I remember.']
['BORACHIO', 'I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she                                 looks out Hero’s bedroom window.']
['DON JOHN', 'How will that kill this marriage?']
['BORACHIO', 'That part is up to you. Go to the Prince, your brother, and tell                                 him that he has done a terrible thing by matching the renowned                                 Claudio—whom you greatly admire—with such a                                 tainted whore as Hero.']
['DON JOHN', 'What will be my evidence?']
['BORACHIO', 'Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero,                                 and kill Leonato. Is there anything else you wish?']
['DON JOHN', 'That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to                                 accomplish it.']
['BORACHIO', 'Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone. Tell them                                 you know that Hero loves me. Pretend to be very concerned about both                                 the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and                                 Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman                                 who’s pretending to be a virgin. Of course, they                                 won’t believe you without proof. Tell them                                 you’ve seen the two of us at Hero’s bedroom                                 window, and then bring them to see for themselves on the night                                 before the wedding. I’ll arrange it so that Hero is away                                 for the night, so what they’ll actually see is Margaret                                 and me at the window, calling each other                                 “Hero” and “Claudio.”Some editors assume “Claudio” is an error, and change it to “Borachio.”“Claudio.” It’ll be such blatant evidence of                                 Hero’s disloyalty that Claudio’s jealousy will                                 quickly turn to certainty, and the wedding will be instantly called                                 off.']
['DON JOHN', 'Make the arrangements, and I’ll do it. Do this                                 carefully, and I will reward you with a thousand gold coins.']
['BORACHIO', 'If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning                                 won’t fail me.']
['DON JOHN', 'I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.']
['BENEDICK', 'Boy!']
['BOY', 'Yes Signior?']
['BENEDICK', 'In my bedroom window there is a book. Go get it and bring it to me                                 here in the orchard.']
['BOY', 'I’m already here, sir.']
['BENEDICK', 'I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there                                 and then come back again.The boy means, “It\\’s as good as done,” but Benedick plays as if he takes the boy literally. ']
['DON PEDRO', 'Well, should we hear some music?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Yes, my lord. Listen to how quiet the evening is, as if                                 it’s purposefully setting the stage for a song.']
['DON PEDRO', ' (speaking so that only                                 CLAUDIOcan hear) Do you see where                                 Benedick is hiding?']
['CLAUDIO', ' (speaking so that only DON                                 PEDROcan hear) Yes, very well, my                                 lord. Once the music has ended, we’ll give him more than                                 he bargained for.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.']
['BALTHASAR', 'Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with                                 my awful singing.']
['DON PEDRO', 'You can tell an artist is excellent when he denies his own                                 perfection. Please, sing for us; don’t make me woo you                                 anymore!']
['BALTHASAR', 'Since you put it that way, I’ll sing. You’re                                 like a suitor who courts a woman insincerely, swearing that he loves                                 her even though he really doesn’t find her worthy.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Come on, please sing. If you’d like to continue this                                 discussion, at least do so with music.']
['BALTHASAR', 'Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single                                 note that’s worthy of note.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Listen to him speaking in quarter notes! Get on with your                                 note-playing now.']
['BENEDICK', ' (to himself) That music must be                                 divine, because their souls have been captivated. Isn’t                                 it strange that strings made of sheep’s guts are capable                                 of drawing men’s souls out of their bodies? Well,                                 I’d rather listen to a                                 plain old hunting horn than this music, when all is said and                             done.']
['BALTHASAR', ' (singing) ']
['DON PEDRO', 'That’s a good song.']
['BALTHASAR', 'And a bad singer, my lord.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Ha! No, no, really, your voice is good enough in a pinch.']
['BENEDICK', ' (to himself) If a dog had howled                                 like that, I would have hung it. I hope his horrible singing                                 doesn’t have any ill effects. I would’ve                                 rather listened to the night raven screech, even if the                                 bird’s noise does give me the plague, as they say it                                 will.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar? Please, get some excellent music,                                 because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom                                 window.']
['BALTHASAR', 'I’ll do the best I can, my lord.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Please do. Goodbye.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Oh yes. (speaking so that only DON                                 PEDRO can hear) Go on, keep walking:                                 our prey is in sight.—I never thought that woman would                                 love any man.']
['LEONATO', 'I didn’t, either. But how wonderful that she should be                                 so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to                             hate.']
['BENEDICK', ' (to himself) Is it possible? Is                                 that the way the wind is blowing?']
['LEONATO', 'Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but                                 she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all                                 understanding.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Maybe she’s just pretending.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Yes, that’s quite likely.']
['LEONATO', 'Oh God! Pretending? No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as                                 this, then.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?']
['CLAUDIO', ' (speaking so that only                                 LEONATOcan hear) Bait the hook well;                                 this fish is going to bite.']
['LEONATO', 'What symptoms, my lord? She will have a seat—you heard                                 my daughter tell you how.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Yes, she did tell us.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Please, please tell me! This is amazing. I would have thought she                                 was invincible against any assault of love.']
['LEONATO', 'I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against                                 Benedick.']
['BENEDICK', ' (to himself) I would take this as a                                 joke if the old man weren’t saying it. Mischief surely                                 can’t be hiding in such a respectable man.']
['CLAUDIO', ' (speaking so that only DON                                 PEDROcan hear) We’ve                                 infected him! Keep it up.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Has she told Benedick how she feels?']
['LEONATO', 'No, and she swears she never will. That’s                                 what’s driving her crazy.']
['CLAUDIO', 'It’s true, Hero says so. Beatrice asks,                                 “Does it make any sense to write and tell him I love him                                 when I have always treated him with scorn?”']
['LEONATO', 'She says this as she begins to write the letter. She’ll                                 be getting up twenty times in a night, sitting there in her slip                                 until she’s written a page. My daughter told me                                 everything.']
['CLAUDIO', 'Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of                                 Hero’s.']
['LEONATO', 'Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it                                 has “Benedick” and                                 “Beatrice” written all over it?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Yes, that’s the one.']
['LEONATO', 'Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates                                 herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows                                 would mock her. “I compare him,” she says,                                 “to myself, and I know that I would mock him if he wrote                                 me such a letter. Yes, even though I love him, I would mock                                 him.”']
['CLAUDIO', 'Then she falls down to her knees, weeps, sobs, beats her breast,                                 tears her hair, prays, and curses: “Oh sweet Benedick!                                 God give me patience!”']
['LEONATO', 'She did indeed, my daughter says so. She worries that Beatrice is                                 so overwrought that she might do herself harm someday.                                 It’s true.']
['DON PEDRO', 'If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.']
['CLAUDIO', 'And what would that accomplish? He’ll just turn it into                                 a joke and torment the poor woman even more.']
['DON PEDRO', 'If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.                                 She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s                                 no doubt that she is virtuous.']
['CLAUDIO', 'And she is very smart.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Except for the fact that she loves Benedick.']
['LEONATO', 'Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body,                                 it’s ten to one that the passion will win. I am sorry for                                 her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her                             guardian.']
['DON PEDRO', 'I wish she were in love with me instead. I would have thrown away                                 all other considerations and made her my wife. Please, tell Benedick                                 about her feelings and see what he has to say.']
['LEONATO', 'Is that a good idea, do you think?']
['CLAUDIO', 'Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says                                 she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that                                 she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll                                 die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one                                 of her usual insults.']
['DON PEDRO', 'She’s probably right. If she offers him her love,                                 it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since,                                 as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.']
['CLAUDIO', 'He’s a very proper man.']
['DON PEDRO', 'Indeed, he is good-looking and carries himself well.']
['CLAUDIO', 'And I swear to God he’s very smart.']
['DON PEDRO', 'He does indeed show sparks of something like wit.']

They seem to pity the lady.                                 It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well,                                 that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized.                                 They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They                                 also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her                                 feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t                                 appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then                                 change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful;                                 it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous;                                 that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart,                                 except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her                                 intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her                                 stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love                                 with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked                                 marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can                                 love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will                                 quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from                                 getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated.                                 When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that                                 I didn’t think I’d live until I got married.                                 Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I                                 think I sense some signs of love in her.']

But Nature never made a woman’s heart as proud                                 and tough as Beatrice’s.

If he’s dark-skinned, Nature                                 must have spilled some ink while drawing his foolish face. If                                 he’s tall, she’ll say he’s a spear                                 topped by an odd head; if he’s short, she says he looks                                 like a badly carved miniature. If he’s talkative,                                 he’s a weathervane, moving in all directions at once; if                                 he’s silent, he’s a block that                                 can’t be moved at all.

['HERO', 'No, it certainly is not admirable to be so perverse and eccentric.                                 But who would dare tell her?

['VERGES', 'If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he                                 isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.']
['DOGBERRY', 'True, and you aren’t supposed to meddle with anyone but                                 the Prince’s subjects.

Also, you’re                                 supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s                                 drunk to go home and go to bed.']
['WATCHMAN', 'And what if they won’t go?']
['DOGBERRY', 'Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober. If                                 even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can                                 say that they’re not the men you thought they                             were.']
['WATCHMAN', 'Very good, sir.']
['DOGBERRY', 'If you meet a thief, you can expect him to be dishonest. The less                                 you have to do with that kind of man, the more honest you will                             be.']

If you encounter a thief, I think the                                 most peaceable thing to do is to let him be himself—and                                 steal away.']

Find a                                 father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and                                 askhim to be patient. Compare the                                 length and width of that man’s sadness against my own;                                 match up all the complaints and strong emotions that run through our                                 bodies.

You can try to                                 comfort a man who feels a pain that you have never felt, but once                                 you feel it too, your sober advice will also turn into passion. You                                 can’t treat madness with rules or bind up insanity with                                 little silken threads or cure heartache with hot air or lighten                                 agony with pat phrases.']

['LEONATO', 'Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio. We’re                                 waiting here for you. Are you still set on marrying my                                 brother’s daughter?']

['BENEDICK', 'I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of                                 wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today. You think I                                 care what I’m called? Well, I don’t. If a man                                 is always afraid of what others think, he won’t even dare                                 to dress nicely, because he’ll be afraid people will talk                                 about him. In short, since I intend to get married, I                                 won’t hear anyone say a bad thing about it. So                                 don’t go making fun of me for what I said before. Man is                                 a giddy, flighty thing: that’s my conclusion. And                                 Claudio—though I’m sure I would have beaten                                 you in our duel—since you’re likely to become                                 my relative, I’ll let you go, unbruised, and love my                                 cousin Hero.']
['CLAUDIO', 'I was sort of hoping you would say no to Beatrice, so that I could                                 have smacked you out of your single life and made you a double dealerHere, “double-dealer” means both married man and adulterer.double dealer. Which you’ll probably turn into anyway, if my                                 cousin Beatrice doesn’t keep you on a short leash.']
['BENEDICK', 'Come on, we’re all friends. Let’s do a                                 dance, and have some fun, before we’re wed.']
['LEONATO', 'We’ll dance after the wedding.']
