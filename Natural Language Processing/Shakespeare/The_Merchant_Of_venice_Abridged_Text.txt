['ANTONIO', 'To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad. I’m tired of it,         and you say you’re tired of it too. But I have no idea how I got so depressed. And         if I can’t figure out what’s making me depressed, I must not understand         myself very well.']
['SALARINO', 'You’re worried about your ships. Your mind is out there getting tossed around         on the ocean with them. But they’re fine. They’re like huge parade floats         on the sea. They’re so big they look down on the smaller ships, which all have to         bow and then get out of the way. Your ships fly like birds past those little boats.']
['SOLANIO', 'Yes, believe me, if I had such risky business ventures in other countries, I’d         be sad too. I’d worry about it every second. I’d constantly be tossing         blades of grass into the air to find out which way the wind was blowing. I’d be         peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways. Everything that made         me worry about my ships would make me sad.']
['SALARINO', 'I’d get scared every time I blew on my soup to cool it, thinking of how a         strong wind could wipe out my ships. Every time I glanced at the sand in an hourglass         I’d imagine my ships wrecked on sandbars. I’d think of dangerous rocks         every time I went to church and saw the stones it was made of. If my ship brushed up against         rocks like that, its whole cargo of spices would be dumped into the sea. All of its silk         shipments would be sent flying into the roaring waters. In one moment I’d go         bankrupt. Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that? It’s         obvious. Antonio is sad because he’s so worried about his cargo.']
['ANTONIO', 'No, that’s not it, trust me. Thankfully my financial situation is healthy. I         don’t have all of my money invested in one ship, or one part of the world. If I         don’t do well this year, I’ll still be okay. So it’s not my         business that’s making me sad.']
['SOLANIO', 'Well then, you must be in love.']
['ANTONIO', 'Oh, give me a break.']
['SOLANIO', 'You’re not in love either? Fine, let’s just say you’re sad         because you’re not in a good mood. You know, it’d be just as easy for you         to laugh and dance around and say you’re in a good mood. You could just say         you’re not sad. Humans are so different.']
['SALARINO', 'I would’ve stayed to cheer you up, if your nobler friends hadn’t         shown up.']
['ANTONIO', 'You’re both very precious to me. But I understand. You need to leave to take         care of your own business.']
['SALARINO', ' (to BASSANIO,         LORENZO, and GRATIANO) Good         morning, gentlemen.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to SALARINO and         SOLANIO) Hello, friends. When are we going to have fun         together again? Just name the time. We never see you anymore. Does it have to be that        way?']
['SALARINO', 'Let us know when you want to get together. We’re available.']
['LORENZO', 'Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio. But         don’t forget, we’re meeting for dinner tonight.']
['BASSANIO', 'Don’t worry, I’ll be there.']
['GRATIANO', 'You don’t look well, Antonio. You’re taking things too seriously.         People with too much invested in the world always get hurt. I’m telling you, you         don’t look like yourself.']
['ANTONIO', 'For me the world is just the world, Gratiano—a stage where every person has         a part to play. I play a sad one.']
['GRATIANO', 'Then I’ll play the happy fool and get laugh lines on my face. I’d         rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun. Why should         any living man sit still like a statue? Why should he sleep when he’s awake? Why         should he get ulcers from being crabby all the time? I love you, and I’m telling         you this because I care about you, Antonio—there are men who always look         serious. Their faces never move or show any expression, like stagnant ponds covered with         scum. They’re silent and stern, and they think they’re wise and deep,         important and respectable. When they talk, they think everybody else should keep quiet, and         that even dogs should stop barking. I know a lot of men like that, Antonio. The only reason         they’re considered wise is because they don’t say anything. I’m         sure if they ever opened their mouths, everyone would see what fools they are. I’ll         talk to you more about this some other time. In the meantime, cheer up. Don’t go         around looking so glum. That’s my opinion, but what do I know? I’m a         fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now. I’ll         finish my lecture after dinner.']
['LORENZO', 'All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime. I must be one of these silent         so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word         in.']
['GRATIANO', 'If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own         voice. I won’t ever let you speak.']
['ANTONIO', 'Goodbye. After that lecture of yours, I’ll start talking a lot.']
['GRATIANO', 'Thank you. The only tongues that should be silent are ox-tongues on a dinner plate and         those that belong to old maids.']
['ANTONIO', 'Is he right?']
['BASSANIO', 'Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice. His point is always like a         needle in a haystack—you look for it all day, and when you find it you realize         it wasn’t worth the trouble.']
['ANTONIO', 'So, who’s this girl, the one you said you were going to take a special trip         for? You promised to tell me.']
['BASSANIO', 'Antonio, you know how bad my finances have been lately. I’ve been living way         beyond my means. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining about having to         cut back.']
['ANTONIO', 'Please let me know your plan, Bassanio. As long as it’s honorable, you can be         sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.']
['BASSANIO', 'Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting         another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the         first. By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back. I’m         telling you this story for a reason. I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve         lost what I owe you. But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way         you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time. Either         we’ll get back all the money I owe you, or else we’ll get back what you         lend me this time, and I’ll just owe you what I already owe you.']
['ANTONIO', 'You know me better than that. You’re wasting your breath. All of this talk         means you have doubts about my friendship. That’s worse than if you bankrupted me.         Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. Tell me.']
['BASSANIO', 'There’s a girl in Belmont who’s inherited a huge amount of money, and         she’s beautiful and—even better—she’s a good         person. I think she likes me. Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me.         Her name is Portia. She’s as rich as that famous Roman heroine Portia, the daughter         of Cato and wife of Brutus. Her wealth is world-famous. Famous and important men have come         in from all over the world to try to marry her. The hair that hangs down on her forehead is         like gold, calling every adventurer to Belmont like a gold rush. Antonio, if I only had         enough money to hold my own against those suitors, I know I could win her!']
['ANTONIO', 'You know right now all my money’s tied up in that cargo that’s still         at sea. I can’t give you the cash you need because I don’t have it. But go         ahead and charge things to me on credit, as much credit as I can get in Venice.         I’ll use all my lines of credit to help you get to Belmont, to Portia. Go see who         will lend money, and I’ll do the same. I’m sure I can get something either         as a business loan, or as a personal favor.']
['PORTIA', 'Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.']
['NERISSA', 'You’d be tired, madam, if you had bad luck rather than wealth and good luck.         But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing. The         best way to be happy is to be in between. When you have too much you get old sooner, but         having just enough helps you live longer.']
['PORTIA', 'Good point, and well said.']
['NERISSA', 'It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.']
['PORTIA', "You think it’s that easy? If doing good deeds were as easy as knowing how to         do them, then everyone would be better off. Small chapels would be big churches, and poor         men’s cottages would be princes' palaces. It takes a good priest to         practice what he preaches. For me, it’s easier to lecture twenty people on how to         be good than to be the one person out of twenty who actually does good things. The brain can         tell the heart what to do, but what does it matter? Cold rules don’t matter when         you’ve got a hot temper. Young people are like frisky young rabbits, and good         advice is like a crippled old man trying to catch them. But thinking like this         won’t help me choose a husband. Oh, the word “choose” is         strange! I can’t choose who I like, or refuse who I dislike. I’m a living         daughter still controlled by the wishes of her dead father. Isn’t it a pain that I         can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?"]
['NERISSA', 'Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their         deathbeds. Your father’s idea was to have a game with three boxes. The suitor who         can figure out whether to pick the gold, silver, or lead box will solve your         father’s riddle—and that suitor’s the man for you. No one will         ever choose the right box who doesn’t deserve your love. But tell me. Do you like         any of the princely suitors who’ve come?']
['PORTIA', 'Run through the list. As you name them I’ll describe them for you, and from my         descriptions you can guess how I feel toward them.']
['NERISSA', 'Well, first there was the prince from Naples.']
['PORTIA', 'Ah, yes, that stallion. All he talks about is his horse. He thinks it’s a         great credit to his character that he can shoe a horse all by himself. I’m afraid         his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith.']
['NERISSA', 'Then there’s the Count Palatine.']
['PORTIA', 'He does nothing but frown, as if he wants to say, “If you don’t         want me, I don’t care.” He doesn’t even smile when he hears         funny stories. If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only         imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man. No, I’d rather be married to a         skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men. God protect me from these        two!']
['NERISSA', 'What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon?']
['PORTIA', 'We might as well call him a man, since God created him. No, I know it’s bad to         make fun of people, but still! His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he         frowns more than the Count Palatine. He was trying to outdo everyone so much that you         couldn’t tell who he was. He started dancing every time a bird sang, and he was so         eager to show off his fencing that he’d fight with his own shadow. If I married         him, I might as well as marry twenty husbands, because he’s like twenty men all         rolled into one! I’d understand it if he hated me, since even if he loved me         desperately, I’d never be able to love him back.']
['NERISSA', 'What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?']
['PORTIA', 'I have no opinion about him. We don’t talk because we don’t         understand each other. He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how         little English I speak. He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who         doesn’t speak your language? He was dressed so oddly too! I think he got his jacket         in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.']
['NERISSA', 'What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord?']
['PORTIA', 'I think he’s very forgiving, since he let the Englishman slap him on the ear         without hitting him back. Rather than defend himself, he just threatened to pay the         Englishman back later. Then the Frenchman promised to help the Scot pay the Englishman back,         and added a slap of his own.']
['NERISSA', 'How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew?']
['PORTIA', 'He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even         worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk. At his best he’s a little less         than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal. If we got married and         he tragically met his demise, I’m sure I could find a way to go on without        him.']
['NERISSA', 'If he offers to play the game and chooses the right box, but then you reject him,         you’ll be disobeying your father’s last wishes.']
['PORTIA', 'I know. So please put a nice big glass of white wine on the wrong box. I know         he’ll get tempted and choose that one. I’ll do anything rather than marry         a drunk, Nerissa.']
['NERISSA', 'You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady. They’ve         all told me what they want, which is to go back home and give up on you—unless         there was some other way to win you than your father’s pick-the-box test.']
['PORTIA', 'I’ll die an old maid unless I can be won according to the rules set by my         father’s will. I’m glad these suitors are sensible enough to stay away.         The only thing I like about them is that they’re not there. I wish them all safe         trips home.']
['NERISSA', 'Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of         Montferrat here once when your father was still alive?']
['PORTIA', 'Yes, yes, that was Bassanio. I think that was his name.']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, madam, that’s the one. He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the         other men I’ve ever seen.']
['PORTIA', 'I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.']
['SERVANT', 'The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam. And         there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the         prince will be here tonight.']
['PORTIA', 'If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the         first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming. If he’s as good as a         saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.         Let’s go, Nerissa.—(to the         SERVANT) Go ahead. As soon as we shut the door on one suitor,         another one starts knocking.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Three thousand ducats, hmmm.']
['BASSANIO', 'Yes, for three months.']
['SHYLOCK', 'For three months, hmmm.']
['BASSANIO', 'As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan. If I default, he’ll pay         you.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm.']
['BASSANIO', 'Can you help me? What’s your answer?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.']
['BASSANIO', 'Your answer?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Antonio’s a good man.']
['BASSANIO', 'Have you heard anything to the contrary?']
['SHYLOCK', 'What? No, no, no, no. What I meant in saying he’s a good man is that he has         enough money to guarantee the loan. But his investments are uncertain right now. He has one         ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies. What’s more, people at the RialtoThe Rialto is the business district of Venice, where the merchants meet.Rialto tell me he has a third ship in Mexico, and a fourth in England, as well as other         business ventures throughout the world.']
['BASSANIO', 'I assure you he can.']
[' SHYLOCK', 'I will be sure he can, before I make the loan. And         I’ll think of a way to be sure. Can I speak with Antonio?']
['BASSANIO', 'If you like, you can dine with us.']
['BASSANIO', 'This is Signor Antonio.']
['SHYLOCK', ' (to himself) He looks just like a guy who’s         robbed me but now comes to beg me for a favor! I hate him because he’s a Christian.         But more than that, I hate him because he stupidly lends money without interest, which         lowers the interest rates here in Venice. If I can just get the upper hand of him once,         I’ll satisfy my old grudge against him. He hates Jews. Even at the Rialto         he’s always complaining about me and my negotiating and my hard-earned profits,         which he calls “interest.”']
['BASSANIO', 'Shylock, are you listening?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’m thinking about how much cash I have on hand. If I remember correctly, I         can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately. But so what? Tubal, a         wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash. But wait a minute! How many months do you         want? (to ANTONIO) Oh, hello,         how are you, signor? We were just talking about you.']
['ANTONIO', 'Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break         that habit to help a friend in need. (to         BASSANIO) Does he know how much you need?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Oh yes, three thousand ducats.']
['ANTONIO', 'For three months.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Yes, I forgot—three months. (to         BASSANIO) You told me that.         (to ANTONIO) Now then, about         your guarantee. Let me see—but listen, Antonio, I thought you said you         don’t lend or borrow with interest.']
['ANTONIO', 'That’s right. That’s not how I do business.']
['SHYLOCK', 'When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir         to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for         her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir—']
['ANTONIO', 'What’s your point? Did he charge interest?']
['SHYLOCK', 'No, he didn’t charge interestShylock uses a story of Jacob from Genesis 30:25–43 to defend his practice of charging interest.charge interest—not in your sense of the word. But         listen to what Jacob did. When he and Laban agreed that all the spotted lambs would be         Jacob’s pay, it was the end of autumn, when the sheep were starting to mate.         Because newborns look like whatever their mother sees during mating, he stuck some spotted         branches into the ground right in front of the sheep, who saw them while they mated. The         mothers later gave birth to spotted lambs, all of which went to Jacob. That was his way of         expanding his business, and it worked. My point is that profit is a blessing, as long as you         don’t steal to get it.']
['ANTONIO', 'That business venture you’re referring to happened because God made it happen         like that. Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened. Are you saying this         story proves that charging interest makes sense? That your interest payments are like         Jacob’s sheep?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I can hardly tell the difference; I make my money multiply as fast as those sheep. But         listen to me, signor—']
['ANTONIO', 'Watch out, Bassanio. The devil can quote Scripture for his own use. An evil soul using         a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you. He looks like a good apple but         he’s rotten at the core. Oh, liars can look so honest!']
['SHYLOCK', 'Three thousand ducats. That’s a nice even sum. Three months from twelve months         of the year. Let me see. The interest rate will be—']
['ANTONIO', 'Well, Shylock? Are you going to loan us the money?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in         the Rialto. I have always just shrugged and put up with it because Jews are good at         suffering. You called me a heathen, a dirty dog, and you spit on my Jewish clothes. And all         because I use my own money to make a profit. And now it looks like you need my help. All         right then. You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say         that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a         stray mutt out your front door. And now you’re asking for money. What can I tell         you? Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money? Is it possible for a mutt         to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and         submissive voice say:']
['ANTONIO', 'I’ll probably call you those names again and spit on you, and reject you again         too. If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we         were your friends. When did friends charge interest? Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.         If your enemy goes bankrupt, it’s easier for you to take your penalty from        him.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Look at you getting all riled up! I want to be friends with you, and forget all the         times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me. I want to give you what you need, and         not charge a penny of interest—but you won’t listen to me! I’m         making a kind offer—zero percent financing.']
['BASSANIO', 'That really would be kind.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’ll show you how kind I am. Come with me to a notary and we’ll make         it official. And let’s add a little clause just for a joke. If you don’t         repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our         contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of         whatever part of your body I like.']
['ANTONIO', 'It’s a deal. I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are         nice.']
['BASSANIO', 'No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me! I’d rather go without         the money.']
['ANTONIO', 'Don’t worry about it, man, I won’t have to pay any penalty. In two         months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than         three times that much from my investments.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Oh father Abraham, what kind of people are these Christians? Their own meanness teaches         them to suspect other people!—Please tell me this. If he fails to repay me by         the deadline, what would I get out of such a penalty? A pound of human flesh taken         isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef. I’m just offering         this as a favor to a friend. If he agrees, great. If not, goodbye. And I hope you         won’t think badly of me.']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Then meet me right away at the notary’s. Give him the instructions for our         amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away. I need to         check in at home first, because one of my careless servants is in charge right now.         I’ll see you soon.']
['ANTONIO', 'Hurry up, my Jewish friend.']
['BASSANIO', 'I don’t like it when a villain acts nice.']
['ANTONIO', 'Come on, there’s no reason to worry. My ships will come home a month before         the money is due.']
['MOROCCO', 'Don’t hold my skin color against me. I was born and raised in the sun, which         is why I’m dark-skinned. But I’m as red-blooded as any man. Show me the         best-looking person born in the freezing north, where the sun barely thaws the icicles.         I’ll win your love by cutting myself to prove to you I have redder blood than he         does. I’m telling you, madam, my skin color has made brave men fear me and Moroccan         girls love me. I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling         queen.']
['PORTIA', 'Being good-looking isn’t the only way to my heart, you know. I have other         criteria for choosing a husband. Not that it matters, because the box test takes away my         free choice anyway. But if my father hadn’t restricted me like         this—forcing me to marry whoever wins his test—then you’d         have had as good a chance to marry me as any of the suitors I’ve met so far,         prince.']
['MOROCCO', 'Thank you for saying that. Show me the caskets and let me try my luck. I swear by my         sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman         three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth. I would act braver         than the bravest man on earth. I would grab bear cubs from a ferocious mother bear, or tease         a hungry lion—all of this in order to win your love, lady. But this is bad! If         the hero Hercules and his servant Lychas rolled the dice, which would win? Not the greater         hero. Just the one who happened to be luckier that time. And just as Hercules could be         beaten by his servant, blind luck could make me lose this test and make someone worse than         me win. If that happened, I’d die of sadness.']
['PORTIA', 'You have to take your chances. Either don’t choose at all, or swear beforehand         that if you choose incorrectly you’ll never talk about marriage to any woman again.         Think about it carefully.']
['MOROCCO', 'Fine, I swear I won’t ever get married if I choose incorrectly. Let me take my         chances.']
['PORTIA', 'Let’s go to the temple first. You can take your chances after dinner.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master. The         devil’s on my shoulder, tempting me. He’s saying,         “Gobbo,” “Launcelot Gobbo,”         “Good Launcelot,” or “Good Gobbo,” or         “Good Launcelot Gobbo”—“use your legs and         run away.” But my conscience says, “No, Launcelot, calm down,         don’t run away.” The devil’s urging me to leave.         “Go away!” he says. “Run away! Be tough,”         says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my         heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good         boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest         woman, since my father cheated on my mother. Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay         put.” “Go,” the devil says. “Don’t         go,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” I say,         “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say,         “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d         stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil. But if I ran away from the Jew,         I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.         Certainly the Jew is the devil incarnate, and my conscience is giving me a hard time by         telling me to stay with the Jew. The devil’s advice is nicer. I’ll run,         devil. Tell me to run, and I’ll run.']
['GOBBO', 'Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?']
['LAUNCELOT', ' (to himself) Good heavens, it’s my father. He         doesn’t recognize me because he’s half-blind—or more than         half-blind, somewhere between half-blind and totally blind. I’ll play a little game         with him.']
['GOBBO', 'Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left. Oh, and then at the         very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the         Jew’s house.']
['GOBBO', 'Good heavens, those are difficult directions. Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot,         who lives with him, is still there?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?         (speaking so no one else can hear) Watch out, I’m         going to pull a good prank here.—Is that who you’re talking        about?']
['GOBBO', 'He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor         man’s son. His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and,         thank God, likely to live a long time.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Well, his father can be whatever he wants to be. We’re talking about young         Master Launcelot.']
['GOBBO', 'Please don’t call him that, sir. He’s just Launcelot.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'But excuse me, ergo, old man,         ergo, I’m asking you if you’re talking         about young Master Launcelot.']
['GOBBO', 'Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.']
['LAUNCELOT', ' Ergo“Ergo” means “therefore” in Latin. Launcelot is using the word to prove he’s an educated gentleman but seems to have no idea what it means.Ergo         , Master Launcelot. But please don’t talk about         Master Launcelot, old man. The young gentleman, submitting to the fates, the three sisters         who control destiny, and other branches of learning like that, is deceased. Or, to put it in         plain language, he’s gone to heaven.']
['GOBBO', 'Oh, no. God forbid! The boy was going to support me in my old age!']
['LAUNCELOT', 'What am I, a cane? How could I support anyone? Don’t you recognize me,        father?']
['GOBBO', 'Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir. But please tell me, is my         boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'You really don’t recognize me, father?']
['GOBBO', 'Sir, I’m half-blind. I don’t know you.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me. It takes a wise father to         know his own child. Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son. Give me your         blessing. The truth will come to light, and murder can’t be hidden         long—a man’s son may hide, but truth will always come out.']
['GOBBO', 'Please stand up! I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Come on, quit fooling around. Give me your blessing. I’m Launcelot, who was         your boy, is your son, and will be your child.']
['GOBBO', 'I can’t believe you’re my son.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'I don’t know what to say to that, but the fact is I’m Launcelot, the         Jew’s servant, and Margery, your wife, is my mother.']
['GOBBO', 'Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery. If you’re Launcelot, then         you’re my own flesh and blood. (feels the back of         LAUNCELOT’s head) My Lord, what a bushy beard you         have! You’ve got more hair on your chin than Dobbin my horse has in his        tail.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward. I’m sure he had more         hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.']
['GOBBO', 'Lord, how you’ve changed! How are you and your master getting along?         I’ve brought him a present. How are you?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'I’m all right. But I’ve decided to run away, and I can’t         wait to get going. My master’s a total Jew. You’re giving him a present?         Give him a noose to hang himself. He’s starving me to death. You can see my ribs so         well you can count them. I’m glad you’ve come, father. Give me your         present to give to Master Bassanio. He gives his servants beautiful new uniforms.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to an attendant) All right, go ahead. But do everything         quickly. Supper must be ready at five at the latest. Make sure these letters get delivered,         get the uniforms made, and tell Gratiano to come visit me soon.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Go talk to him, father.']
['GOBBO', ' (to BASSANIO) God bless         you, sir!']
['BASSANIO', 'Thank you. What do you want with me?']
['GOBBO', 'This is my son, sir. He’s a poor boy—']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Not a poor boy, but the rich Jew’s servant, who wants, as my father will         explain—']
['GOBBO', 'He wants very much, sir, as one might say, to work for—']
['LAUNCELOT', 'To put it briefly, I work for the Jew, and I want, as my father will tell         you—']
['GOBBO', 'He and his master aren’t exactly friends—']
['LAUNCELOT', 'To be brief, the truth is that the Jew has done me wrong, and that forces me         to—as my father, an old man, will inform you—']
['GOBBO', 'I have a present I’d like to give you, sir. And I want to request         that—']
['LAUNCELOT', 'To make a long story short, the request is about me, as this good old man will tell         you. Even though I’m his son and I’m the one saying it, this old man is a         poor man—']
['BASSANIO', 'One of you do the talking. What do you want?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'To work for you, sir.']
['GOBBO', 'That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.']
['BASSANIO', 'I know who you are. You can have what you want. I spoke with your master Shylock today,         and he recommended you to me. If you want to leave a rich Jew to work for a poor gentleman,         you’re welcome to.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Do you know the old proverb “The grace of God is enough,” sir?         It could be divided between you and my boss Shylock—you have “the         grace of God,” and he has “enough.”']
['BASSANIO', 'Nicely put.—Go with your son, old man.—Say goodbye to your old         master and find your way to my house. (to attendants) Give         him a uniform that’s a little nicer than the others. Make sure it gets done.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Father, go ahead. I can’t get a job, can I? I can’t talk well, no.         (reading his own palm) If any man in Italy has a palm good         enough to swear on a Bible with, it’s me. I’ve got very good luck!         Here’s my life line. It shows a few wives—fifteen wives is nothing.         Eleven widows and nine maids is a humble beginning for one man. It seems I’ll         almost drown three times, and my life will be in danger when I’m caught in bed with         another man’s wife! But these little lines are the escape routes I can take to get         out of that one. If luck’s a lady, she’s good at this business. Father,         let’s go. I’ll leave the Jew behind in the blink of an eye.']
['LEONARDO', 'I’ll do my best.']
['GRATIANO', ' (to LEONARDO)         Where’s your master?']
['LEONARDO', 'He’s walking over there, sir.']
['GRATIANO', 'Signor Bassanio!']
['BASSANIO', 'Gratiano!']
['GRATIANO', 'I have a favor to ask.']
['BASSANIO', 'Anything.']
['GRATIANO', 'Don’t say no. Let me go with you to Belmont.']
['BASSANIO', 'Well, if you have to go, you have to go. But listen to me, Gratiano. Sometimes you get         a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude. These things look good on         you, of course, and to people like you and me there’s nothing wrong with it. But in         places where people don’t know you, your behavior might seem too wild. Please, try         to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about         me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.']
['GRATIANO', 'Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about. I’ll be         solemn-looking, I’ll talk with respect, and I’ll only swear once in a         while. I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more.         While grace is being said, I’ll be modest and say         “amen”—I’ll watch my manners as if I’m         trying to please my grandma. If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.']
['BASSANIO', 'Well, we’ll see how you act.']
['GRATIANO', 'Okay, but tonight doesn’t count. You can’t judge me based on what I         do tonight.\u2003\u2003']
['BASSANIO', 'No, it’d be a shame for you to act serious tonight. I’d rather see         you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun. Anyway, I have to say         goodbye to you now. I’ve got some business to take care of.']
['GRATIANO', 'I have to join Lorenzo and the others, but we’ll visit you at supper        time.']
['JESSICA', 'I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this. It’s hell in         our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil. But goodbye. Here’s a         ducat for you. You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest         of your new master. Give him this letter. (gives LAUNCELOT         a letter) Do it secretly. Goodbye. I don’t want my         father to see me talking to you.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Goodbye. My tears show you my feelings, my beautiful pagan, my sweet Jew! I’m         sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you. But goodbye. It’s not manly         to cry. Goodbye.']
['JESSICA', 'Goodbye, Launcelot.']
['LORENZO', 'No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my         house, and come back in an hour.']
['GRATIANO', 'But we haven’t made any preparations.']
['SALARINO', 'We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.']
['SOLANIO', 'The masquerade party might turn out terribly if we don’t manage things         carefully. I think it’s better to call it off.']
['LORENZO', "It’s only four o'clock now. We have two hours to get ready."]
['LAUNCELOT', ' (he gives LORENZO         the letter) If you don’t mind opening this letter,         you can find out for yourself.']
['LORENZO', 'I recognize the handwriting. It’s beautiful handwriting. And the beautiful         hand that wrote this letter is whiter than the paper it’s written on.']
['GRATIANO', 'I bet it’s a love letter!']
['LAUNCELOT', ' (to LORENZO) May I be         excused, sir?']
['LORENZO', 'Where are you going?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the        Christian.']
['LORENZO', ' (he gives LAUNCELOT         money) Hold on, take this. Tell Jessica I won’t fail         her. Tell her in private.—Go, gentlemen, get ready for the masquerade tonight. I         have someone who can be my torchbearer.']
['SALARINO', 'All right, I’ll go get things ready.']
['SOLANIO', 'Me too.']
['LORENZO', 'Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.']
['SALARINO', 'It’s good we’re doing this.']
['GRATIANO', 'Wasn’t that letter from Jessica?']
['LORENZO', 'I have to tell you everything. She’s told me how I can get her out of her         father’s house. She’s also told me what gold and jewels she owns, and         she’s described the page’sA page is a young male servant.page’s uniform she’s keeping to wear as a disguise. If her father ever goes to heaven, it’ll be because his daughter’s so good. She’ll never be punished with bad luck—unless it’s because her father is an unbelieving         Jew. Come with me. (gives GRATIANO         the letter) You can look this letter over as you go.         Beautiful Jessica will be my torchbearer.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Well, you’ll see it with your own eyes. You’ll see the difference         between working for Shylock and working for         Bassanio.—(calling for his daughter)         Jessica!—You won’t eat like a pig like you used to do at my         place.—Jessica!—And sleep, and snore, and wear your clothes         out.—Jessica, I’m calling you!']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Jessica!']
['SHYLOCK', 'Who asked you to call her? I’m not asking you to call her.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.']
['JESSICA', 'Did you call me? Do you need something?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica. Here are my keys.—But why         should I go? I wasn’t invited because they like me. They’re just         flattering me. But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful         Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house. I don’t feel like going.         Things aren’t going my way right now. I know because I dreamed of money bags last         night.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Please go, sir. My new master is expecting your approach.']
['SHYLOCK', 'And I’m expecting his reproach.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'And they’ve been plotting things together. I’m not saying         you’ll get a masquerade party, but if you do, I predicted it. I knew there would be         a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the         morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the         afternoon.']
['SHYLOCK', 'What, there’s going to be a masquerade? Listen to me, Jessica, lock my doors         up, and when you hear the drum and the nasty squealing of the flute, don’t climb up         to the windows. Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the         Christian fools with painted faces. Block up my house’s ears—I mean the         windows. Don’t let the noise of shallow fools enter my serious house. I swear,         I’m in no mood to go out to dinner tonight, but I’ll go         anyway.—Launcelot, go tell them I’ll come.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'I’ll go ahead of you, sir. (to         JESSICA) Mistress, be on the lookout when you’re         staring out the window. A Christian’s coming who’ll be worth a         Jewess’s glance.']
['SHYLOCK', 'What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?']
['JESSICA', 'He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.']
['SHYLOCK', 'The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a         snail when he works. He sleeps all day like a cat. Bees that don’t work         can’t stay in my hive, so I’m letting him go, handing him off so he can         waste money for his new boss, the man who borrowed money from me. Anyway, Jessica, go         inside. I might come back soon. Do as I told you. Shut the doors after you. As the saying         goes, lock things up, and you’ll get to keep them.']
['JESSICA', 'Goodbye. If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll         lose a daughter.']
['GRATIANO', 'This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.']
['SALARINO', 'He’s late.']
['GRATIANO', 'Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.']
['SALARINO', 'Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been         married forever.']
['GRATIANO', 'That’s always true. Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when         he sat down? Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked         them the first time? We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it         when we get it. It’s like when a ship sails out of the harbor with all its flags         waving, gently pushed by the wind. When that ship returns, her timber is all weather-beaten         and her sails are ragged. That same wind makes the ship thin and poor.']
['SALARINO', 'Here comes Lorenzo. We’ll talk about this later.']
['LORENZO', 'My dear friends, thanks for your patience. I had business that made me late. When you         have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long. Come over         here. My future father-in-law, the Jew, lives here.—Hey! Who’s in         there?']
['JESSICA', 'Who are you? Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.']
['LORENZO', 'I’m Lorenzo, your love.']
['JESSICA', 'Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my         love—who else do I love so much? And now who but you knows whether I’m         yours?']
['LORENZO', 'As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.']
['JESSICA', 'Here, catch this box. It’ll be worth your while. I’m glad         it’s nighttime and you can’t see me. I’m ashamed of my disguise.         But love is blind, and lovers can’t see the silly things they do around each other.         If they could, Cupid himself would be embarassed to see me dressed up as a boy.']
['LORENZO', 'Come down here. You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade.']
['JESSICA', 'What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing? The truth         is, I’m behaving like a loose woman. The torchbearer is supposed to bring light and         love, but I should be hidden away in the dark.']
['LORENZO', 'You’re hidden away, sweetheart, dressed up like a boy. Come on quickly. Time         flies at night, and we’re late for Bassanio’s feast.']
['JESSICA', 'I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right        away.']
['GRATIANO', 'My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice!']
['LORENZO', 'God, I’m crazy about her. She’s wise, if I’m judging her         right. She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see. And she’s loyal, as she has         proven. And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and         faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart.']
['ANTONIO', 'Who’s there?']
['GRATIANO', 'Signor Antonio?']
['ANTONIO', "Gratiano, where is everybody? It’s nine o'clock! Our friends are all         waiting for you. There’s no masquerade tonight. The wind is blowing right, so         Bassanio’s going onboard immediately. I’ve sent twenty people to look for         you."]
['GRATIANO', 'I’m glad. I want to head out tonight.']
['PORTIA', ' (to servant) Go open the curtains and show the different         boxes to the prince.']
['MOROCCO', 'The first one, the gold one, has an inscription that says, “He who chooses         me will get what many men want.” The second one, the silver one, says,         “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” And this third one is         made of dull lead. It has a blunt warning that says, “He who chooses me must         give and risk all he has.” How will I know if I chose the right one?']
['PORTIA', 'One of them contains my picture. If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with         the picture.']
['MOROCCO', 'I wish some god could help me choose! Let me see. I’ll look over the         inscriptions again. What does the lead box say? “He who chooses me must give and         risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what? For lead? Risk         everything for lead? This box is too threatening. Men who risk everything hope to make         profits. A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless. So I         won’t give or risk anything for lead. What does the silver one say?']
['PORTIA', ' (she hands him a key) There, take it, prince. And if my         picture’s in there, then I’m yours.']
['MOROCCO', 'Damn it! What’s this? It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye         socket. I’ll read it aloud.']
['PORTIA', 'Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone         who looks like him will make the same choice.']
['SALARINO', 'I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him. I’m sure Lorenzo         isn’t on their ship.']
['SOLANIO', 'That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints. The duke went with him to         search Bassanio’s ship.']
['SALARINO', 'He got there too late. The ship was already sailing. But once he got there, the duke         learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola. In any case, Antonio         assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.']
['SOLANIO', 'I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in         the streets. “My daughter, oh my ducats, oh my daughter! Ran off with a         Christian! Oh my Christian ducats! Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter, a sealed         bag, two sealed bags of ducats, of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter, and         jewels—two stones, two rich and precious stones—stolen by my         daughter! Justice, find the girl! She has the stones on her, and the        ducats.”']
['SALARINO', 'I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his         daughter, and his ducats!”']
['SOLANIO', 'I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.']
['SALARINO', 'That’s a good point. I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a         Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel. I thought about         Antonio when he told me. I silently hoped it wasn’t his ship.']
['SOLANIO', 'You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly,         because it might upset him.']
['SALARINO', 'There’s no nicer guy in the whole world. I saw Bassanio and Antonio say         goodbye. Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back. Antonio answered         “Don’t rush. Don’t do a sloppy job for my sake, Bassanio. Stay         until everything is finished. As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a         factor in your plans. Be happy and concentrate your thoughts on love and how to win your         love.” Then his eyes started tearing up. He turned his face away. Then he shook         Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.']
['SOLANIO', 'I think he only loves life because of Bassanio. Let’s go find him and cheer         him up.']
['SALARINO', 'Yes, let’s do that.']
['NERISSA', 'Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick. The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and         he’s coming to make his choice now.']
['PORTIA', 'Look, here are the boxes, prince. If you choose the one that contains my picture,         we’ll be married right away. But if you fail, you have to leave immediately. No         pleas will be allowed.']
['ARRAGON', 'I swore I’d do three things. First, I can never tell anyone what box I choose.         Second, if I choose the wrong box, I’ll never propose marriage for the rest of my         life. Third, if I pick the wrong box, I’ll leave immediately.']
['PORTIA', 'Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.']
['ARRAGON', 'Okay, I’m ready. I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for! Gold,         silver, and common lead. “He who chooses me must give and risk all he         has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything         for you. What does the golden box say? Hmm, let me see:']
['PORTIA', 'You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.']
['ARRAGON', 'What’s this? A picture of an idiot holding a scroll up for me to read!         I’ll read it.—It looks so unlike Portia! This outcome isn’t         what I hoped for, or what I deserve. “The one who chooses me will get what he         deserves”! Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head?         Is this my prize? Don’t I deserve more than this?']
['PORTIA', 'Judging what you deserve is one thing. Offending you is something very different, so         I’ll keep my mouth shut.']
['ARRAGON', 'What does this say?']
['PORTIA', 'These men are like moths, drawn to these boxes as if they were flames. This is how the         candle burned the moth. Oh, these fools! When they choose, they only know how to        lose.']
['NERISSA', 'You know what they say. Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who         you’ll marry.']
['PORTIA', 'Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.']
['MESSENGER', 'Where’s lady Portia?']
['PORTIA', 'Here. How can I help you, sir?']
['MESSENGER', 'Madam, a young Venetian man has arrived to tell us his master is about to arrive. This         lord has sent gifts. Besides his nice polite greetings, his gifts are expensive. I         haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love. This servant has arrived         before his master the way a sweet spring day hints about a lush summer. But there’s         never been an April day as promising as this.']
['PORTIA', 'Please don’t tell me any more. I’m almost afraid you’re         going to tell me he’s a relative of yours, because you’re going so crazy         praising him. Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so         courteously.']
['NERISSA', 'I hope it’s Bassanio coming to win Portia!']
['SOLANIO', 'So, what’s the news on the Rialto?']
['SALARINO', 'Well, there’s a rumor that Antonio had a ship carrying expensive cargo that         shipwrecked in the English Channel on the Goodwin Sands, a very dangerous sandbar. Many         ships have sunk there, according to rumors.']
['SOLANIO', 'I hope this new rumor is a lie, like the gossiping widow’s claim that she was         sorry her third husband died! But it’s true—I don’t want to         get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if         I only had a title good enough to match his!—']
['SALARINO', 'Come on, get to the point.']
['SOLANIO', 'What are you saying? Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship.']
['SALARINO', 'I hope that’s all he loses.']
['SOLANIO', 'Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops         my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew.']
['SHYLOCK', 'You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my         daughter’s plans to run away.']
['SALARINO', 'That’s true. I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she         ran off.']
['SOLANIO', 'And Shylock knew his daughter was ready to run away. It’s natural for children         to leave their parents.']
['SHYLOCK', 'She’ll be damned for it.']
['SALARINO', 'That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.']
['SHYLOCK', 'My own flesh and blood turned against me! A rebel!']
['SOLANIO', 'No! Your flesh still rebelsSolanio pretends to think Shylock means he can’t control his own sexual urges.flesh still rebels at your age?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.']
['SALARINO', 'You two are totally different. Your flesh is more different from hers than coal is from         ivory. There’s more difference between your bloods than between red wine and white.         But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?']
['SHYLOCK', 'That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a         spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug         in front of the other merchants. Let him think about his own debt. He liked to call me a         loan shark; let him think about his debt to me. He used to lend money as a favor between         Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt.']
['SALARINO', 'But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay. What’s that         good for?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’ll use it for fish bait. You can’t eat human flesh, but if it feeds         nothing else, it’ll feed my revenge. He’s insulted me and cost me half a         million ducats. He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my         race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and         why? Because I’m a Jew. Doesn’t a Jew have eyes? Doesn’t a Jew         have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions?         Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the         same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter         just like a Christian? If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed? If you tickle         us, don’t we laugh? If you poison us, don’t we die? And if you treat us         badly, won’t we try to get revenge? If we’re like you in everything else,         we’ll resemble you in that respect. If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s         the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction? Revenge. If a Christian offends a Jew,         what punishment will he come up with if he follows the Christian example? Of course, the         same thing—revenge! I’ll treat you as badly as you Christians taught me         to—and you’ll be lucky if I don’t outdo my teachers.']
['SERVANT', ' (to SOLANIO and         SALARINO) My master Antonio is at his house and would like to         speak to you both.']
['SALARINO', 'We’ve been looking for him everywhere.']
['SOLANIO', 'Here comes another Jew. You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the         devil himself turned into a Jew.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Hello, Tubal. Any news from Genoa? Did you find my daughter?']
['TUBAL', 'I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find        her.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Oh, oh, oh! One of the stolen diamonds cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt! I         never felt the curse of the Jews until now. I never felt it until now—two         thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels! I wish my daughter         were dead at my feet wearing those jewels! I wish she were in her coffin here, with the         ducats in her coffin! You couldn’t find out anything about them? Why? I         don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them. Loss upon loss! The         thief left with so much, and I’m spending so much to hunt down the         thief—and still I’m not satisfied! I haven’t gotten my         revenge. The only luck I have is bad luck. Nobody suffers but me. Nobody’s crying         except me.']
['TUBAL', 'Well, other men have bad luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—']
['SHYLOCK', 'What, what, what? Bad luck, bad luck?']
['TUBAL', 'He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Thank God, thank God! Is it true, is it true?']
['TUBAL', 'I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Thank you, Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.']
['TUBAL', 'I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me! I’ll never see my gold again.         Eighty ducats in one shot! Eighty ducats!']
['TUBAL', 'I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he         won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’m very glad about that. I’ll hound him. I’ll torture him.         I’m very glad.']
['TUBAL', 'One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a        monkey.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Damn her! You’re torturing me, Tubal. That was my turquoise ring! Leah gave it         to me before we were married. I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of         monkeys.']
['TUBAL', 'But Antonio’s certainly ruined.']
['SHYLOCK', 'That’s true, that’s very true. Tubal, go find me a police officer to         arrest Antonio. Get him ready two weeks ahead of time.—I’ll take         Antonio’s heart if he can’t pay. With him out of Venice, I can make         whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal. Meet me at the        synagogue.']
['PORTIA', ' (to BASSANIO) Please wait         a day or two before making your choice. If you choose wrong, I’ll lose your         company. So wait a while. Something tells me—not love, but         something—that I don’t want to lose you, and you know that if I hated         you I wouldn’t think that. But let me put it more clearly in case you         don’t understand—though I know girls aren’t supposed to         express their thoughts—I’m just saying I’d like you to stay         here for a month or two before you undergo the test for me. I could tell you how to choose         correctly, but then I’d be disregarding the oath I took. So I’ll never         tell. But you might lose me by making the wrong choice. If you do choose wrong,         you’ll make me wish for something very bad. I’d wish I had ignored my oath         and told you everything. God, your eyes have bewitched me. They’ve divided me in         two. One half of me is yours, and the other half—my own half, I’d call         it—belongs to you too. If it’s mine, then it’s yours, and so         I’m all yours. But in this awful day and age people don’t even have the         right to their own property! So though I’m yours, I’m not yours. If         there’s no chance for me to be yours, then it’s just bad luck. I know         I’m talking too much, but I do that just to make the time last longer, and to         postpone your test.']
['BASSANIO', 'Let me choose now. I feel tortured by all this talking.']
['PORTIA', 'Tortured, BassanioPortia and Bassanio are role-playing here, pretending to be torturer and victim.Bassanio? Then confess to your crime. Tell us about the treason you’ve mixed in with         your love.']
['BASSANIO', 'The only treason I’m guilty of is worrying that I’m never going to         get to enjoy you. Treason has nothing at all to do with my love. They’re as         opposite as hot and cold.']
['PORTIA', 'Hmmm, I’m not sure I believe what you’re saying. Men under torture         will confess anything.']
['BASSANIO', 'Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.']
['PORTIA', 'All right then, confess and live.']
['BASSANIO', '“Confess and love” is more like it. Oh, torture’s fun         when my torturer tells me what I have to say to go free! But let me try my luck on the         boxes.']
['PORTIA', 'Go ahead, then. I’m locked in one of them. If you really love me,         you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him. Play         some music while he chooses. Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before         the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses.         But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music         should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned         monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on         his wedding morning, calling him to the church.']

['BASSANIO', 'You can’t always judge a book by its cover. People are often tricked by false         appearances. In court, someone can deliver a false plea but hide its wickedness with a         pretty voice. In religion, don’t serious men defend sins with Scripture, covering         up evil with a show of good. Every sin in the world manages to make itself look good         somehow. How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god         of war? Take another example: beauty. It can be bought by the ounce in makeup, which works         miracles. Women who wear it the most are respected the least. It’s the same thing         with hair. Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful. But         you can buy that kind of hair as a wig, and wigs are made from dead people’s hair.         Decoration’s nothing but a danger, meant to trick and trap the viewer. A lovely,         cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can         hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty. Nowadays, everyone’s fooled by appearances.         So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like         the gold that Midas couldn’t eat. And I’ll have nothing to do with the         pale silver either, the metal that common coins are made of. But this humble lead one,         though it looks too threatening to promise me anything good, moves me more than I can say.         So this is the one I choose. I hope I’m happy with my choice!']
['PORTIA', ' (to herself) All my other emotions are vanishing into         thin air, as all my doubts and desperation and fears and jealousy are all flying away! Oh, I         need to calm down, make my love and my joy less intense. I’m feeling this too         strongly. Please make my love less, or I’m going to overindulge, making myself         sick.']
['BASSANIO', ' (opening the lead box) What do we have here? A picture         of beautiful Portia! What artist captured her likeness so well? Are these eyes moving? Or do         they just seem to move as my eyes move? Her sweet breath forces her lips open, a lovely         divider of lovely lips. And look at her hair, looking like a golden mesh to trap the hearts         of men, like little flies in a cobweb. The painter was like a spider in creating it so         delicately. But her eyes—how could he keep looking at them long enough to paint         them? I would’ve expected that when he finished one of them, it would have         enraptured him and kept him from painting the other. But I’m giving only faint         praise of the picture, just as the picture, as good as it is, is only a faint imitation of         the real woman herself. Here’s the scroll that sums up my fate:']
['PORTIA', 'You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio. What you see is what you get. Though I         wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty         times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times         richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty,         possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate. What you’re         getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl. I’m happy that at least I’m         not too old to learn new things. I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and         I can learn. I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and         you can guide me as you wish. Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you. Just         a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen         over myself. But as of right this second all these things are yours. With this ring I give         them all to you.']
['BASSANIO', 'Madam, you’ve left me speechless, but my feelings are responding to your         words. I’m as confused as a crowd of people going wild after hearing their prince         give a speech. But the day I take this ring off will be the day I die. If you see me without         it, you can be confident I’m dead.']
['NERISSA', 'My lord and lady, it’s now our turn, who have been watching as our dreams came         true. Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and         lady!”']
['GRATIANO', 'My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for. And when you         get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.']
['BASSANIO', 'Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.']
['GRATIANO', 'I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord. I can fall in love         just as quickly as you can, and I loved Nerissa as soon as I laid eyes on her. You fell in         love with Portia, and I fell in love with Nerissa, because I’m not in the habit of         delaying any more than you are, my lord. Your fate depended on those boxes, and it turns out         that mine did too. I couldn’t help but chase her. I started making love vows to her         till my mouth was dry. Then finally she said she loved me and would marry me if you two got         married as well.']
['PORTIA', 'Is that true, Nerissa?']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, madam, it is, if it’s all right with you.']
['BASSANIO', 'And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano?']
['GRATIANO', 'Yes, my lord.']
['BASSANIO', 'Then we’d be honored to have you join us in our wedding ceremony.']
['GRATIANO', ' (to NERISSA)         Let’s bet them a thousand ducats that we will have a son first.']
['NERISSA', 'You want to stake the money down now?']
['GRATIANO', 'Hey, if I lay down my “stakeGratiano puns on “stake” as both money that is bet and penis.stake,” I’ll never be able to         have a son. But who’s this coming? Lorenzo and his pagan girlfriend? What, and my         old Venetian friend Salerio?']
['BASSANIO', 'Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio. I hope my position in this new house is firm enough to         allow me the right to welcome my friends.']
['PORTIA', 'I do too, my lord. They’re entirely welcome.']
['LORENZO', ' (to BASSANIO) Thank you,         sir. I didn’t intend to come see you. But I ran into Salerio on the way, and he         begged me to come along with him until I couldn’t say no.']
['SALERIO', 'That’s true, and with good reason. This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.         (he gives BASSANIO        a letter) ']
['BASSANIO', 'Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.']
['SALERIO', 'He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are         serious. His letter will tell you how he’s doing.']
['GRATIANO', ' (pointing at JESSICA)         Nerissa, welcome this stranger. —Salerio, welcome. Any news from Venice?         How’s the great merchant Antonio doing? I know he’ll be happy to hear of         our success. We’re like the ancient hero Jason, we went looking for the Golden         Fleece and we won it!']
['SALERIO', 'I wish you’d won the         fleeceSalerio puns on “fleece” (the wool from a ram) and “fleets” (groups of ships).fleece he lost.']
['PORTIA', 'Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale. Some good friend of his must         have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much. What, does the news         only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half         the burden this letter brings you.']
['BASSANIO', 'Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My         darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my         veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the         truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I         should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a         dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a         letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it         is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business         ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon,         North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks?']
['SALERIO', 'Not one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably         wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so         eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the         state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself,         and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his         contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his         contract with Antonio.']
['JESSICA', 'When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen,         that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio         owed. And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor         Antonio.']
['PORTIA', 'Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?']
['BASSANIO', 'Yes, he’s my best friend, the kindest man and most courteous to others.         He’s more honorable than anyone else in Italy.']
['PORTIA', 'How much does he owe the Jew?']
['BASSANIO', 'Three thousand ducats.']
['PORTIA', 'What, that’s all? Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt. I’d pay         twelve thousand before I’d let a friend like that suffer in the slightest because         of you. First come with me to church to get married. Then you can leave for Venice to see         your friend. You have to go, because you’ll never sleep next to me peacefully         without settling this. I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times         over. When it’s paid, bring your friend back. Until you get back, Nerissa and I         will live like virgins and widows. Come on, let’s go, because you’re going         to leave me the same day we get married. Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.         Since it’s costing me a lot to marry you, I’ll think of you as even more         precious. But let me hear the letter from your friend.']
['BASSANIO', ' (he reads) ']
['PORTIA', 'Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!']
['BASSANIO', 'Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry. But I won’t sleep         till I get back.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Jailer, watch out for this one. Don’t try to convince me to feel sorry for         him. This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest. Jailer, keep an eye on         him.']

But         since I’m a dog, beware my fangs. The duke will give me justice.—I do         wonder, jailer, how you can be so foolish as to let this prisoner out of his cell.']
['ANTONIO', 'Please, listen to me.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I want my bond. I won’t listen to you. I want my bond, so stop talking. I         won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.         Don’t follow me. I’m not talking with you. I want my bond.']
['SOLANIO', 'He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.']
['ANTONIO', 'Leave him alone. I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore. He         wants me dead. I know the real reason. I’ve often given money to people who were         unable to pay back their loans to him. That’s why he hates me.']
['SOLANIO', 'I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.']
['ANTONIO', 'The duke can’t deny the law, because that would threaten the security of all         foreign merchants in Venice, and that’s how the city makes its money. If the         government disregards the law, it will be discredited. So go. I’ve lost so much         weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to         spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s         go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt. After that, I         don’t care what happens.']
['LORENZO', 'Madam, I hope you don’t mind my saying that I admire your noble respect for         friendship, which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this. If         you only knew the man you’re helping out, and what a faithful gentleman he is and         how much he loves your husband, I know you’d be even prouder of your kindness than         you normally might be.']
['PORTIA', 'I’ve never regretted doing good, and I don’t now. Friends who spend a         lot of time together and really care equally for each other must have many traits in common.         Since Antonio’s my husband’s best friend, they must be very similar men.         In that case, the money I’ve sent is a small price to pay to rescue someone who         resembles my Bassanio, who’s like my own soul.—Anyway, let’s         change the subject, since I feel like I’m starting to flatter myself. I have a         favor to ask of you. Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my         husband comes back.']
['LORENZO', 'Madam, with all my heart. I’ll do anything you ask.']
['PORTIA', 'I’ve already spoken to my staff about this. They’ll consider you and         Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So goodbye until we meet         again.']
['LORENZO', 'I hope you can relax and enjoy yourself!']
['JESSICA', 'I hope you find peace and happiness, my lady.']
['PORTIA', 'Thank you. I wish you the same. Goodbye, Jessica.']
['BALTHAZAR', 'I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.']
['PORTIA', 'Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.         We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.']
['NERISSA', 'Will they see us?']
['PORTIA', 'They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men. I’ll bet you         anything that I’ll be handsomer than you when we’re both dressed up.         I’ll wear my sword more gracefully, and speak like a teenage boy, and walk with a         manly stride rather than my ladylike steps. I’ll talk about fights like a bragging         youth, and I’ll tell cute lies about honorable ladies who fell in love with me and         got sick and died when I rejected them. They just died, what could I do! Then I’ll         start feeling sorry for them, wishing I hadn’t killed them. I’ll tell         twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago. I know         a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.']
['NERISSA', 'Why, are we turning to men?']
['PORTIA', 'What kind of question is that! If I had a dirty mind, I’d think you meant         turning to men for sex. Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is         waiting for us at the gate. So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.         That’s why I’m worried about you. I’ve always been         straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think. Cheer up, because I         think you’re going to hell. There’s only one hope for you, and even         that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.']
['JESSICA', 'What hope is that, may I ask?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'You can hope your father isn’t your real father. Maybe your mother fooled         around, and you aren’t the Jew’s daughter.']
['JESSICA', 'That really is an illegitimate hope. Then I’d be punished for the sins of my         mother.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your         mother. When you avoid one trap, you fall into another. You’re in trouble either         way.']
['JESSICA', 'My husband will save me. He’s made me a Christian.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'He was wrong to do that. There were enough Christians before—as many of         them as could stand to live near each other. All these new Christians will make the price of         hogs go up. If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on         a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it.']
['JESSICA', 'I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot. Here he        comes.']
['LORENZO', 'You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into         dark corners like this!']
['JESSICA', 'No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo. Launcelot and I can’t         agree on anything. He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a         Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting         Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.']
['LORENZO', 'I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African         servant. The MoorLike the prince of Morocco, the servant referred to is a “Moor” or North African, in this case a black woman. Launcelot puns on the words “Moor” and “more.”Moor is pregnant with your child, Launcelot.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be. Well,         even if she’s a less than honest woman, she’s still a lot         more respectable than I thought at first.']
['LORENZO', 'Any fool can make puns! I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and         talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do. Go in and tell the servants to get         ready for dinner.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'That’s already been done, sir. They’re all ready to eat        dinner.']
['LORENZO', 'Good Lord, what a clown you are! Tell them to make the         dinner.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'That’s also been done, sir. The word you’re looking for is “coverBy “cover,” Launcelot means “set the table.”cover .”']
['LORENZO', 'Will you cover, then?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'No, sir—I know my duty.']
['LORENZO', 'You keep finding ways to mock me! Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?         Please understand my simple message: go tell the servants to set the table and bring in the         food, and we’ll come in to dinner.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it. As for the food, it will be served         in covered dishes. As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right.']
['LORENZO', 'Oh, he’s good at bending words around! The fool has memorized a whole army         full of fancy words. I know jesters in better positions, with the same talents he has. They         also like to digress from the topic at hand by playing with language. Anyway, how are you,         Jessica? And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?']
['JESSICA', 'I like her more than I can say. Bassanio should live an upstanding life because having         a wife like Portia is a blessing. It’s as if he found heaven here on earth. And if         he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.         Imagine what would happen if two gods in heaven made a bet. If one of them used Portia as         his stake, the other god would have a hard time coming up with a human woman to match her         value. The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.']
['LORENZO', 'As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.']
['JESSICA', 'I’ll be the judge of that!']
['LORENZO', 'I’ll give you a chance to judge later. First let’s go to        dinner.']
['JESSICA', 'No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.']
['LORENZO', 'No, please, save it for dinner conversation. That way, no matter what you say,         I’ll digest it with everything else.']
['JESSICA', 'In that case I’ll serve you up like a dish of food.']
['DUKE', 'Is Antonio here?']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, sir, I’m here.']
['DUKE', 'I feel sorry for you. You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch         incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.']
['ANTONIO', 'They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what         he’s doing. But since he remains stubborn, and there’s no legal way to         protect me from his malice, I’ll just have to take what he’ll give me.         I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and        anger.']
['DUKE', 'One of you go call the Jew into court here.']
['SALERIO', 'He’s standing ready outside the door. Here he comes, my lord.']
['DUKE', 'Make room so he can stand in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I         agree—that you’re just pretending to be cruel. They think that at the         last second you’re going to show mercy and pity, which will be more surprising than         the bizarre cruelty that you seem to be showing now. And even though you’re here to         collect the penalty—a pound of this poor merchant’s         flesh—they think you’ll not only let it go, but out of humanity and         love you’ll forgive some portion of the principal he owes you too. In doing so         you’ll be taking pity on him for his many recent losses, which have been large         enough to send even the greatest merchant out of business, and make even the most         hard-hearted Turk or Tartar feel sorry for him. What do you say? We all expect a nice answer         from you, Jew.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath         to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract. If you refuse to allow me to do         so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered. You’re going to         ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats. I         won’t answer that. Let’s just say it’s because I feel like it. Is         that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten         thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Do you have your answer yet?']
['BASSANIO', 'That’s no answer, you heartless man. It doesn’t excuse your cruel         behavior.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I don’t have to give you answers that you like.']
['BASSANIO', 'Does everyone kill what they don’t love?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Does anyone hate something and not want to kill it?']
['BASSANIO', 'Disliking something isn’t the same thing as hating it.']
['SHYLOCK', 'What, would you let a snake bite you twice?']
['ANTONIO', ' (to BASSANIO) Please         don’t bother arguing with the Jew. You might as well go stand on the beach and ask         the ocean to get smaller. You might as well ask a wolf why he killed the lamb and made its         mother cry.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to SHYLOCK) Instead of         your three thousand ducats, here are six thousand.']
['SHYLOCK', 'If you offered me six times that, I wouldn’t accept it. I would choose to take         my penalty.']
['DUKE', 'How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any        now?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong?         Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and         mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them. Should I say         to you, “Set them free! Let them marry your children! Why are you making them         work so hard? Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as         you”? No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.”         And that’s just how I’m answering you. The pound of flesh that I want from         him was very expensive. It’s mine and I’m going to get it. If you refuse         me, the laws of Venice have no validity. I await justice. So answer me. Will I get        it?']
['DUKE', 'I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today. He’s         a legal expert I sent for to act as judge and help settle this matter.']
['SALERIO', 'My lord, a messenger is waiting outside with letters from Bellario. He’s just         come from Padua.']
['DUKE', 'Bring us the letters. Call the messenger in.']
['BASSANIO', 'Cheer up, Antonio! Keep up your courage, man! I’ll give the Jew my flesh,         blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me.']
['ANTONIO', 'I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die. The         weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop. Bassanio, the best thing you can do         is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone.']
['DUKE', 'Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, my lord. Bellario sends his greetings.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to SHYLOCK) Why are you         sharpening your knife so eagerly?']
['SHYLOCK', 'To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.']
['GRATIANO', 'You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.         No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half         as sharp as your hatred. Can’t any prayers reach your heart?']
['SHYLOCK', 'No, none that you’re smart enough to make.']
['GRATIANO', 'Oh, you’re going to hell, you disgusting dog. Killing you would be justice.         You almost make me forget that I’m a Christian. You make me want to agree with the         philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies. Your vicious dog         soul used to belong to a wolf that was killed for slaughtering humans. When he died, his         cruel soul passed out of his body and went into yours while you were lying in your unholy         mother’s womb. That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and        ravenous.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing         out your lungs by speaking so loud. Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind. I         stand here with the law on my side.']
['DUKE', 'This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert.         Where is he?']
['NERISSA', 'He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in.']
['DUKE', 'With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the         meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.']
['PORTIA', 'Yes, my lord.']
['DUKE', 'Welcome. Please have a seat. Are you familiar with the case currently before the        court?']
['PORTIA', 'Yes, thoroughly. Which one is the merchant? And which one is the Jew?']
['DUKE', 'Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward.']
['PORTIA', 'Is your name Shylock?']
['SHYLOCK', 'Shylock is my name.']
['PORTIA', 'Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from         proceeding.—(to         ANTONIO) He has a claim on you, correct?']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, so he says.']
['PORTIA', 'Do you acknowledge the contract?']
['ANTONIO', 'Yes, I do.']
['PORTIA', 'Then the Jew must show you mercy.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Why do I have to do that? Tell me.']
['PORTIA', 'No one shows mercy because he has to. It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the         ground. Mercy is a double blessing. It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives         it. It’s strongest in the strongest people. It looks better in a king than his own         crown looks on him. The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of         majesty, the focus of royal authority. But mercy is higher than the scepter. It’s         enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself. Kingly power seems most like         God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice. So although justice is your         plea, Jew, consider this.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I take all responsibility for my decisions. I want the law, the penalty, and the         fulfillment of my contract.']
['PORTIA', 'Can’t he pay back the money?']
['BASSANIO', 'Yes. I’m offering to pay it back right this moment—even twice the         sum. If that’s not enough, I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that         much, and I’ll give you my hands, my head, and my heart as security. If         that’s not enough, then you’re just evil and         malicious.—(to the         DUKE) I beg you, just this once, use your authority to bend         the law. Do a great right by doing a little wrong. Don’t let this devil have his         way.']
['PORTIA', 'That can’t happen. There’s no power in Venice that can change an         established decree. The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions         will result. That can’t happen.']
['SHYLOCK', 'A DanielIn the Bible, as a young man, Daniel shows great wisdom while acting as judge in the case of Susanna, who was falsely accused.Daniel has come to judgment, yes, a Daniel!—Oh, wise young judge, I honor        you!']
['PORTIA', 'Please, let me review the contract.']
['SHYLOCK', ' (he hands PORTIA a paper)         Here it is, judge, here it is.']
['PORTIA', 'Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.']
['SHYLOCK', 'But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven. Should I perjure my soul by disobeying         it? No, not for all of Venice.']
['PORTIA', 'The money wasn’t paid back! And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh         nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have         mercy. Take three times your money. Tell me to tear up this contract.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’ll tear it up when it’s paid. You seem like a good judge. You know         the law. Your explanation has made sense. I urge you to deliver your verdict. I swear that         nothing anyone can say will change my mind. I’m sticking to the contract.']
['ANTONIO', 'I beg the court to deliver the verdict.']
['PORTIA', 'Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Oh, good judge! Oh, you excellent young man!']
['PORTIA', 'The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the        contract.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Very true. Oh wise judge! You’re so much older than you look!']
['PORTIA', ' (to ANTONIO) So bare your         chest.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Yes, his chest! That’s what the contract says, doesn’t it, judge?         “Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.']
['PORTIA', 'Yes. Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I have it ready.']
['PORTIA', 'Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to         death.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Is that called for in the contract?']
['PORTIA', 'Not explicitly, but so what? It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I can’t find it. It’s not in the contract.']
['PORTIA', ' (to ANTONIO) You,         merchant, do you have anything to say?']
['ANTONIO', 'Not much. I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.         Goodbye.']
['BASSANIO', 'Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself. But life itself, my wife, and         the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is. I’d give it         all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to         save you.']
['PORTIA', 'Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that        offer.']
['GRATIANO', 'I have a wife I love. I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to         make this dog Jew change his mind.']
['NERISSA', 'It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back. That wish         of yours could start quite an argument back at home.']
['SHYLOCK', 'That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands. I have a daughter. I wish         she’d married any one of Barabbas’sIn the Bible, Barabbas is a thief who is set free at the same time that Jesus is condemned to death.Barabbas’s descendants instead of a Christian!—We’re wasting time. Please,         deliver the sentence.']
['PORTIA', 'A pound of this merchant’s flesh is yours. The court awards it and the law         authorizes it.']
['SHYLOCK', 'What a righteous judge!']
['PORTIA', 'And you have to cut this flesh from his chest. The law allows it, and the court awards         it.']
['SHYLOCK', 'What a wise judge! Come on, get ready.']
['PORTIA', 'But wait a moment. There’s something else. This contract doesn’t give         you any blood at all. The words expressly specify “a pound of         flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of         Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property         under Venetian law.']
['GRATIANO', 'Oh, what an upright judge!—Pay attention, Jew.—Oh, what a smart         judge!']
['SHYLOCK', 'Is that the law?']
['PORTIA', 'You can see for yourself. You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get         more justice than you bargained for.']
['GRATIANO', 'Oh, what a wise judge!—Pay attention, Jew. A wise judge!']
['SHYLOCK', 'In that case I’ll take their offer. Pay me three times the amount of the loan         and let the Christian go.']
['BASSANIO', 'Here is the money.']
['PORTIA', 'Wait! The Jew will have justice. Wait, don’t rush! He’s not getting         anything except the penalty.']
['GRATIANO', 'Oh, Jew, what an upright judge this is! What a wise judge!']
['PORTIA', 'So get ready to cut off the flesh. Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more         than exactly a pound of flesh. If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if         it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even         so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.']
['GRATIANO', 'A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew! I’ve got you now, pagan.']
['PORTIA', 'Why is the Jew waiting? Take your penalty.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Give me my money and let me go.']
['BASSANIO', 'I have it ready for you. Here it is.']
['PORTIA', 'No, he refused it publicly, in open court. He will have only justice and his        penalty.']
['GRATIANO', 'A Daniel, I keep saying it! A second Daniel!—Thank you, Jew, for teaching         me that word.']
['SHYLOCK', 'I won’t even get the original three thousand ducats back?']
['PORTIA', 'You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril,        Jew.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Well, then, I hope he chokes on it! I’m not staying here to argue        anymore.']
['PORTIA', 'Wait a minute, Jew. The law has another hold on you. The laws of Venice state that if a         foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to         kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods. The other half goes to the         state. Whether the offending person lives or dies is up to the         duke—there’s no one else to appeal to. In your predicament         you’ve earned that punishment, because you’ve clearly contrived         indirectly—and directly too—to take the life of the defendant. So         get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.']
['GRATIANO', 'Beg to be allowed to hang yourself! But if you’ve handed over all your wealth         to the state, you don’t even have enough money left to buy a rope. So         you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense.']
['DUKE', 'I want you to see the difference between us, so I pardon you even before you ask for a         pardon. Half of your wealth goes to Antonio. The other half goes to the state. However, if         you show a proper humility, I may reduce this penalty to a fine.']
['PORTIA', 'Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s.']
['SHYLOCK', 'No, go ahead and take my life. Don’t pardon that. You take my house away when         you take the money I need for upkeep. You take my life when you take away my means of making         a living.']
['PORTIA', 'What mercy can you show him, Antonio?']
['GRATIANO', 'A hangman’s rope free of charge. Nothing else, for God’s sake!']
['ANTONIO', 'If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property,         I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the         gentleman who recently stole his daughter. I only ask two more things. First, Shylock must         immediately become a Christian. Second, he must make a will here in this court that leaves         all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies.']
['DUKE', 'He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.']
['PORTIA', 'Are you satisfied, Jew? What do you say?']
['SHYLOCK', 'I’m satisfied.']
['PORTIA', ' (to NERISSA) Clerk, draw         up a document to make his gift official.']
['SHYLOCK', 'Please let me go. I’m not well. Send the deed after me and I’ll sign         it.']
['DUKE', 'Go, but sign the deed.']
['GRATIANO', ' (to SHYLOCK) When         you’re baptized a Christian, you’ll have two godfathers. If I’d         been the judge, you would’ve had ten more—twelve jurors to sentence you         to death rather than baptism.']
['DUKE', ' (to PORTIA) Sir, please         come home with me to dinner.']
['PORTIA', 'I’m very sorry, sir, but I have to go to Padua tonight. I should really leave         right away.']
['DUKE', 'I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this         gentleman a reward. In my opinion, you owe him a lot.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to PORTIA) Sir, thanks         to you my friend and I have been freed from paying some awful penalties today. Instead of         giving the Jew the three thousand ducats he’s owed, we give it to you in gratitude         for your kind efforts.']
['ANTONIO', 'And even then we’re still indebted to you. We owe you love and service         forever.']
['PORTIA', 'Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough. In saving you I consider myself         well paid. My thoughts were never on money. I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet         again. I wish you well. Now, I’ve got to go.']
['BASSANIO', 'Sir, I really feel the need to give you something. Take some memento from us as a token         of our gratitude, not as a fee. Please do two favors for me. First, don’t refuse         me, and second, excuse me for insisting.']
['PORTIA', 'Since you keep insisting, I’ll do as you say.         (to ANTONIO) Give me your         gloves. I’ll wear them for your sake. (to         BASSANIO) And as a souvenir of your appreciation,         I’ll take this ring from you. Don’t pull your hand back. I won’t         take anything more than this, and you can’t refuse me this.']
['BASSANIO', 'This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing. I’d be ashamed to         give you this.']
['PORTIA', 'I don’t want anything but that. Now that I think about it, I really want        it.']
['BASSANIO', 'There’s more to this ring than its cash value. I’ll give you the most         expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it.         But as for this ring, please excuse me.']
['PORTIA', 'I see you like to make big offers, sir. First you taught me how to beg, and now I think         you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.']
['BASSANIO', 'Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife. When she put it on my finger, she made         me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.']
['PORTIA', 'Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts. If your wife’s not a madwoman,         and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever         if you give it to me. Well, anyway, goodbye.']
['ANTONIO', 'Bassanio, let him have the ring. Consider how much he deserves it, and weigh that,         along with my friendship, against your wife’s order.']
['BASSANIO', ' (he gives GRATIANO         the ring) Go, Gratiano, run and catch up with him. Give him         the ring, and take him to Antonio’s house if you can. Go quickly.']
['PORTIA', 'Find out where the Jew’s house is. Give him this deed and have him sign it.         We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back. Lorenzo will be         happy with what we’ve done.']
['GRATIANO', ' (he gives PORTIA         BASSANIO’s ring) Sir, you’re lucky I caught         up with you. Bassanio thought about it some more and sent this ring to you. He would like to         invite you to dinner.']
['PORTIA', 'I can’t have dinner with him. Please tell him I accept his ring with thanks.         And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?']
['GRATIANO', 'I’ll do that.']
['NERISSA', ' (to PORTIA) Sir, may I         speak with you? (speaking so that only         PORTIAcan hear) I’ll see if I can get my         husband’s ring, which I made him swear to keep forever.']
['PORTIA', ' (to NERISSA) I bet         you’ll be able to. They’ll swear they gave the rings to men. But         we’ll deny it and outswear them too.—']
['NERISSA', ' (to GRATIANO) Sir, will         you show me to Shylock’s house now?']
['LORENZO', 'The moon’s bright tonight. I think that on a night like this, when the wind         blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound, TroilusTroilus was the son of King Priam of Troy. His lover, Cressida, was sent to the Greek camp, where she betrayed him.Troilus climbed up onto the walls of Troy and sighed for Cressida in the Greek camp.']
['JESSICA', 'On a night like this, ThisbeThisbe had agreed to meet her lover Pyramus, but was frightened away by a lion. Pyramus killed himself because he thought the lion had eaten her, and Thisbe killed herself when she found Pyramus dead.Thisbe saw the lion’s shadow and ran away in fear.']
['LORENZO', 'On a night like this, DidoDido, the queen of Carthage, was abandoned by her lover Aeneas.Dido stood holding a willow branch on the seashore, begging her lover to come back to her         in Carthage.']
['JESSICA', 'On a night like this, MedeaMedea used her magic to help her lover, Jason’s father. Later, Jason betrayed her, and she murdered their children in revenge.Medea gathered magic herbs to rejuvenate old Aeson.']
['LORENZO', 'On a night like this, Jessica ran away from the wealthy Jew and stole his money. She         ran away from Venice all the way to Belmont with her spendthrift lover.']
['JESSICA', 'On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart         with vows of love, but not one vow was true.']
['LORENZO', 'On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things         about her lover, and he forgave her.']
['JESSICA', 'I’d get the better of you in this storytelling game, but somebody’s         coming. I hear his footsteps.']
['LORENZO', 'Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?']
['STEPHANO', 'A friend.']
['LORENZO', 'A friend? What friend? What’s your name, please, friend?']
['STEPHANO', 'My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive         here at Belmont before sunrise. She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying         for a happy marriage.']
['LORENZO', 'Who’s coming with her?']
['STEPHANO', 'No one except her maid and a holy hermit. Has my master returned yet?']
['LORENZO', 'No, he hasn’t, and we haven’t heard from him.—But         let’s go in, Jessica. We’ll get ready to welcome the mistress of the house         back home.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Hey, hey! Hey! Yoo-hoo!']
['LORENZO', 'Who’s shouting?']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Hey! Have you seen Master Lorenzo! Master Lorenzo, hey! Hey!']
['LORENZO', 'Stop hollering, man! I’m here.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Hey! Where, where?']
['LORENZO', 'Here.']
['LAUNCELOT', 'Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news. My master will be here         in the morning.']
['LORENZO', 'My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive. But I guess it         doesn’t matter. Why should we go in?—Stephano, tell the household staff         that your mistress is about to arrive, and bring some musicians outside here.']
['JESSICA', 'I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music.']
['LORENZO', 'That’s because your soul is paying attention to the music. Take a wild herd of         animals, or young untrained colts, leaping around like crazy, roaring and neighing loudly,         which they have to do because it’s in their blood—but if they happen to         hear a trumpet, or any kind of music, they all stand still. Sweet music makes their wild         eyes peaceful. That’s why the poet Ovid wrote that the great musician Orpheus could         make']
['PORTIA', 'That light we see is coming from my hall. Look how far that little candle sends its         light! That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.']
['NERISSA', 'While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.']
['PORTIA', 'Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones. A governor shines as brightly as a         king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody. Music,        listen!']
['NERISSA', 'It’s your music, madam, from your house.']
['PORTIA', 'Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context. I think         that music sounds much better at night than it does during the day.']
['NERISSA', 'The night’s silence makes it sound better.']
['PORTIA', 'The crow sings as well as the lark when no one’s listening. If the nightingale         sang during the day, when every goose is honking, nobody would think it sang any better than         a wren. How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen! Quiet now! Look         how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!']
['LORENZO', 'If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.']
['PORTIA', 'He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad        voice.']
['LORENZO', 'Dear lady, welcome home.']
['PORTIA', "We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare. We hope         they’re better off because of our prayers. Have they come back?"]
['LORENZO', "No, ma'am, they haven’t. But a messenger came ahead to tell us they         were on their way."]
['PORTIA', 'Go inside, Nerissa. Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone. You must not,         either, Lorenzo—or you, Jessica.']
['LORENZO', 'Your husband’s near. I hear his trumpet. We’re not tattle-tales,         madam, don’t worry.']
['PORTIA', 'I think this night is just like sick daylight. It only looks a little paler. It looks         like a day when the sun is hidden.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to PORTIA) If you walked         outside at night, it would be daylight here at the same time as on the other side of the         world.']
['PORTIA', 'I’ll give light“Light” could mean having loose morals.light to men, but I’ll never be light or unchaste. An unfaithful wife makes a         husband worry, and I’ll never let Bassanio worry if I can help it. I hope God         figures it all out! Welcome home, my husband.']
['BASSANIO', 'Thank you, darling. I’d like to introduce you to my friend. This is Antonio,         my dearest friend. We are closely tied.']
['PORTIA', 'You should be tied to him, since he tied himself up so much for you.']
['ANTONIO', 'But I’ve been paid back well.']
['PORTIA', 'Sir, welcome to our house. But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut         short these polite words.']
['GRATIANO', ' (to NERISSA) I swear by         that moon over there that you’re doing me wrong! I’m telling the truth! I         gave it to the judge’s clerk. I wish the guy I gave it to had been castrated, since         you’re getting so upset about it.']
['PORTIA', 'What, an argument already? What’s the matter?']
['GRATIANO', 'We’re arguing about a hoop of gold, a cheap little ring she gave me, that had         a little inscription on it, nothing more than a knife-maker’s attempt at poetry. It         said, “Love me and don’t leave me.”']
['NERISSA', 'How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring? You swore to         me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried         with you. If you didn’t want to take care of it for my sake, you should have just         because you made so many vows that you’d take care of it. And now you claim you         gave it to a judge’s clerk! No, I swear to God that clerk will never grow a beard         on his face.']
['GRATIANO', 'He will if he lives long enough to become a man.']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.']
['GRATIANO', 'I swear I gave it to a youth, a kind of boy, a little stunted boy, no taller than         yourself. He was the judge’s clerk, a chatty boy who wanted it as a fee. I         didn’t have the heart to say no to him.']
['PORTIA', 'I have to be honest with you. You were wrong to give away your wife’s first         gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your         body.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to himself) Maybe I should cut off my left hand and         swear I lost the ring defending it.']
['GRATIANO', 'Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too. And then his         clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine. Neither of them would         take anything but the two rings.']
['PORTIA', 'Which ring did you give away, my lord? Not the one I gave you, I hope.']
['BASSANIO', 'If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it. But you see my finger         doesn’t have the ring on it. It’s gone.']
['PORTIA', 'Just as there’s no ring on your finger, there’s no truth in your         heart. I swear I’ll never get into your bed until I see the ring again!']
['NERISSA', ' (to GRATIANO) Me neither,         until I see mine again!']
['BASSANIO', 'My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to         him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t         accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.']
['PORTIA', 'If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you         is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t         have let it go. Who would be so unreasonable as to insist on taking the ring if         you’d defended it with any kind of zeal? Who would have had so little         self-restraint that they’d insist on getting a ring with ceremonial value?         Nerissa’s got the right idea. I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the         ring!']
['BASSANIO', 'No, I swear, madam. No woman got it from me, but an expert in civil law who refused         three thousand ducats but asked instead for the ring, which I denied him. I watched him         leave looking discontented, even though he had saved the life of my good friend. What could         I say, my dear? I had to send it to him. I was ashamed and wanted to show my good manners. I         just couldn’t dishonor myself by acting ungrateful to him. Please forgive me, good         lady. If you’d been there, I think you would have begged me to give him the        ring.']
['PORTIA', 'Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house! Since he has the jewel I loved,         which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to         him. I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my         husband’s bed. I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it. So         don’t spend one night away from this house. Watch me like a hawk. If you         don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as         my bedfellow.']
['NERISSA', ' (to GRATIANO) And         I’ll have his clerk as mine. So be careful when you leave me to my own        devices.']
['GRATIANO', 'Well, go ahead. But don’t let me catch him, because if I do I’ll         break that clerk’s pen.']
['ANTONIO', 'All these quarrels are about me.']
['PORTIA', 'Don’t be upset. You’re welcome in our home in spite of everything         that’s going on.']
['BASSANIO', 'Portia, forgive me for this mistake that I had to make. All these friends are my         witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself         reflected—']
['PORTIA', 'Did you hear that! He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him. He         should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll        believe!']
['BASSANIO', 'No, just listen to me. If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an         oath with you again.']
['ANTONIO', 'I lent my body once to make him rich. If it hadn’t been for the gentleman who         now owns your husband’s ring, my body would’ve been lost. I’d be         the guarantee again, promising my soul this time as penalty, if your husband ever breaks a         vow again knowingly.']
['PORTIA', ' (she gives ANTONIO         a ring) Then you’ll be my guarantee. Give him this.         And tell him to hold on to it better than the other one.']
['ANTONIO', ' (he gives BASSANIO         PORTIA’s ring) Here, Bassanio, swear that         you’ll keep this ring.']
['BASSANIO', 'My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!']
['PORTIA', 'I got it from him. I’m sorry, Bassanio, but the legal expert slept with me in         exchange for this ring.\u2003\u2003\u2003']
['NERISSA', ' (she takes out a ring) And I’m sorry too,         Gratiano, but that stunted lawyer’s clerk slept with me last night in exchange for         this ring.']
['gratiano', 'This is like fixing roads in the summer when they don’t need to be fixed!         What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?']
['PORTIA', 'Don’t be crass.—You all look confused.         (she takes out a letter) Here’s a letter. Read it at         your leisure. It comes from Padua, from Bellario. You’ll find out that Portia was         the lawyer, and Nerissa was her clerk. Lorenzo here will testify that I left the house right         when you did, and just returned. I haven’t yet entered my         house.—Antonio, welcome. I have better news than you expect in store for you.         (she gives ANTONIO         another letter) Open this letter. You’ll find out         that three of your ships have suddenly arrived in the harbor loaded with a great deal of         wealth. You’ll never guess what a strange coincidence it was that I came across         this letter.']
['ANTONIO', 'I’m speechless.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to PORTIA) You were the         doctor, and I didn’t even recognize you?']
['GRATIANO', ' (to NERISSA) Were you the         clerk with whom my wife’s going to cheat on me?']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man.']
['BASSANIO', ' (to PORTIA) My sweet         lawyer, you’ll be my bedfellow. When I’m not there, you can sleep with my         wife.']
['ANTONIO', 'Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too. I’ve read in         this letter that my ships have safely come to harbor.']
['PORTIA', 'How are you, Lorenzo? My clerk has some comforting news for you, too.']
['NERISSA', 'Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.         (she gives LORENZO a document)         This is from the rich Jew, for you and Jessica. It’s a special testament. After he         dies, you’ll inherit everything he owns.']
['LORENZO', 'Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.']
['PORTIA', 'It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied         about what happened. Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions         truthfully.']
['GRATIANO', 'All right, then. My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait         till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning. When         the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal         expert’s clerk. In any case, I won’t worry about anything for the rest of         my life more than keeping Nerissa’s ring safe.']
