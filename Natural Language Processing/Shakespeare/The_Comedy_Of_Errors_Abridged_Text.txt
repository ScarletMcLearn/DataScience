['EGEON', 'Continue, Solinus, and bring on my downfall. Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.']
['DUKE', 'Merchant of Syracuse, stop your begging: I’m not inclined to bend our laws. The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus, our well-behaved countrymen. Lacking the money to ransom themselves, these merchants were executed under your duke’s harsh laws, and this has erased all looks of pity from my face. Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns. No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself. Your possessions, even if we calculate their worth very generously, don’t even add up to a hundred marks. Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.']
['EGEON', 'At least I have this comfort: when you finish speaking, my troubles will also end, at sundown.']
['DUKE', 'Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.']
['EGEON', 'Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefs–that’s the hardest task you could impose on me. But I’ll do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion, and not a desire to break the law, that brought me to this fate. I’ll tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say. I was born in Syracuse, and I married a woman–a fortunate woman, except for having been married to me. And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad. I lived with her in joy, and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum. Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wife’s fond embraces. I hadn’t been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadn’t been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreed–alas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship.']
['DUKE', 'No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that. For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.']
['EGEON', 'Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadn’t come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her part–the poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinth–or so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now you’ve heard how I was separated from everything I love. It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.']
['DUKE', 'And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.']
['EGEON', 'My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendant–who had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brother’s']
['DUKE', 'Poor Egeon! Fate has decreed that you must endure the extremes of terrible misfortune. Believe me, if it weren’t against the law, my crown, my duty, and my position (which princes cannot disobey, not matter how they feel), my very soul would argue your case. But you are sentenced to death, and changing a sentence that’s already been passed would dishonor my title. However, I’ll do what I can for you. I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus. Call any friends you have. Beg or borrow to come up with the ransom. If you can, you live. If not, you are doomed to die. Jailer, take him into custody.']
['JAILER', 'I will.']
['EGEON', 'Hopeless and helpless, I go my way, merely putting off my fatal end.']
['FIRST MERCHANT', 'So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated. Just today, a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here. He couldn’t afford the ransom, so by law, he’ll be put to death before the sun sets. Here’s the money you asked me to hold.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come. It’ll be lunchtime within an hour. Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn. I’m stiff and weary from all this travel. Get going now.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'He’s a trustworthy servant. Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks. Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?']
['FIRST MERCHANT', 'Begging your pardon, but I’ve been invited to see some merchants, who I’m hoping to see a profit from. But if']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Farewell till then. I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.']
['FIRST MERCHANT', 'Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'He leaves me to my own contentment, but that’s the one thing I cannot find. Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean. When that drop fails its task–unnoticed, inquisitive–it dissipates into the ocean and destroys itself. In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Back so soon? Too late is more like it. The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek. She’s hot because lunch is cold; lunch is cold because you’re not home; you’re not home because you’re not hungry; you’re not hungry because you’ve eaten already. But we servants—who know how to properly fast and pray—are being punished for your offenses today.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Hold on a second. Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress? The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I’m not in a joking mood. Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money? We’re strangers here. How dare you let such a large amount escape your keeping?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch. My mistress made me hurry here. If I go back without you, she’ll punish your faults by breaking my head open. I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'That’s enough, Dromio, please. This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time. Where’s the gold I gave you?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Gave me, sir? You didn’t give me any gold.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Come on, you rogue. Quit joking. Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch. My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood. Where are the thousand marksmarks = units of currencymarks you had from me?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I have some marks from you on my head and some of my mistress’s marks on my body. But between the both of you, I don’t have a thousand marks. If I gave those marks back to you, chances are you wouldn’t take them as patiently as I did.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Your mistress’s marks? What mistress do you have?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Your wife, sir. My mistress. At the Phoenix. The one who’s waiting for you to come home for lunch and praying that you’ll get home quickly.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to? There, take that, you scoundrel! (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS) ']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'What are you doing? Stop, for God’s sake! Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money. They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins. If this is true, then I’ll be leaving all the sooner.']
['ADRIANA', "Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running. Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock."]
['LUCIANA', 'Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch. Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying. A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases. If this is so, be patient, sister.']
['ADRIANA', 'Why should men be more free than women?']
['LUCIANA', 'Because their business lies outside the home.']
['ADRIANA', 'Listen, when I behave this way toward him, he hates it.']
['LUCIANA', 'Oh, you should know that he’s the bridlebridle = muzzlelike device used to restrain a horsebridle to your will.']
['ADRIANA', 'Only a mule would agree to that.']
['LUCIANA', 'Why, too much freedom leads to woe. There’s nothing under heaven that doesn’t have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And men—the lords of the wide']
['ADRIANA', 'It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried.']
['LUCIANA', 'No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed.']
['ADRIANA', 'But if you were married, you’d wield some influence.']
['LUCIANA', 'Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders.']
['ADRIANA', 'What if your husband strays elsewhere?']
['LUCIANA', 'I’d endure it until he came home again.']
['ADRIANA', 'Now that’s patience! No wonder she’s waiting to get married. It’s easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise. When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up. And yet, if we were suffering the same kind of pain, we’d complain just as much—if not more! So you, who have no husband causing you problems, want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience. But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.']
['LUCIANA', 'Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see. Here comes your servant—your husband must be coming soon.']
['ADRIANA', 'Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No; but he came at me with two hands—just ask my earsi.e., “He beat me on my ears.”ears.']
['ADRIANA', 'Did you talk to him? Do you know his plans?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Yes, yes, he told me his plans on my ears. Damn his hands—I could barely understandDromio puns on “understand,” using the word to mean “stand up under the force of the beating.”understand it.']
['LUCIANA', 'Did he speak so ambiguously that you couldn’t get a feeling for what he meant?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No; he hit me very clearly and I felt his punches perfectly well. They were so dreadful, I could barely stand up under them.']
['ADRIANA', 'But please, tell me: is he coming home? It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.']
['ADRIANA', 'Horns? You bastard!']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I don’t mean he’s cuckoldcuckold = a man whose wife cheated on him; cuckolds were commonly depicted wearing hornscuckold mad. But he sure is angry. When I asked him to come home to lunch, he asked me for a thousand marks. “It’s lunchtime,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “The meat’s burning,” I said. “My gold,” he said. “Will you come home?” I said.']
['LUCIANA', 'Who said that?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'My master said it. “I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders. Because at the end of it all, that’s where he beat me.']
['ADRIANA', 'Go back again, slave, and bring him home.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Go back again, to be beaten home again? For God’s sake, send somebody else.']
['ADRIANA', 'Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'And he’ll add another knock across. With all these crosses, I’ll have a holy head.']
['ADRIANA', 'Get out of here, you blathering peasant! Bring your master home.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Do I treat you this roundly? You’re kicking me around like I’m a football. You kick me out, he kicks me back. If I keep working for you, I’m going to end up wrapped in leather, like a football.']
['LUCIANA', 'Look at you! You have impatience all over your face.']
['ADRIANA', 'He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him. Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks? That’s because he has squandered my beauty. Am I boring? Have I lost my wit? If my conversation is no longer free and clever, that’s because he’s dulled it—I’m like a sharp tool he’s blunted with a hard piece of marble. Is he charmed by their pretty clothes? Well, that’s not my fault—he’s the one in charge of my spending. What faults can you find in me that weren’t first caused by him? One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty. But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures. I am nothing but a poor, used fool.']
['LUCIANA', 'This jealousy is harming only you! Drive it out of you.']
['ADRIANA', 'Only someone who doesn’t feel this pain could tell me to ignore it. I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here? Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace. I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me. Even the best jewel can be tarnished. Gold, however, can’t be corrupted—though it can be worn down if it’s touched too often. And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior. Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.']
['LUCIANA', 'How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me. I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier. Here he comes.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Said what, sir? When did I say all that?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Just now. Right here. Less than half an hour ago.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You moron, you denied having any gold, and you told me about a mistress and a lunch. And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood. But what’s the joke? Please, master, tell me.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'What, are you mocking me to my face? You think I’m joking? Here. Take that, and that! (beats DROMIO OF SYRACUSE) ']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Stop, sir, for God’s sake! Now this joke has turned serious. Why are you doing this?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection. You pull pranks when I’m in a serious mood. You know, foolish gnats come out in the sunshine, but they creep back into their holes when it’s dark. If you want to crack jokes, first check what kind of mood I’m in and then adjust your behavior to suit me. If you don’t learn this rule, I’ll have to beat it into your sconce.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'You call it my “sconceDromio puns on various meanings of “sconce,”including “head,” “fortress” (which Dromio imagines being attacked with a battering ram), and “curtain.”sconce”? I’d rather call it my “head” so you’d stop battering it. If you keep pounding me, I’ll need a sconce to wrap my head with, or else I’ll have to keep my brain in my chest. But sir, why are you beating me?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Don’t you know?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'All I know is that I’m being beaten.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Should I tell you why?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Yes, and wherefore. You know the old saying: “Every ‘why’ has a ‘wherefore.’”']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', '“Why” first: for defying me. And then “wherefore”: for doing it a second time.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I don’t think any man’s ever been beaten for a “why” and “wherefore” that made so little sense. Well, thank you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Thank me? For what?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Because you gave me something for nothing.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Next time I’ll give you nothing for something. Is it lunchtime?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'No. The meat lacks something that I have.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'What would that be?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'A basting.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Well, then it will be dry.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Why not?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time. There’s a time for all things.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Why not?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Let’s hear it.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Can’t he get it by fine and recoveryFine and recovery = a legal term related to claiming ownership of private propertyfine and recovery?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Yes, he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another man’s lost hair.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair? After all, it’s plentiful in its growth.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Because animals are blessed with hair. With men, he’s been stingy with hair, but he makes up for it by giving them intelligence.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'And not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'The more simpleminded they are, the sooner they lose their hairIn the original Shakespearean line, there are a series of sexual puns and jokes about venereal diseases-venereal disease can cause hair loss; “sound” can mean “healthy,” “thing” can refer to a sexual organ, and “falsing” means “deceptive.”lose their hair. But they have a good time doing so.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Why?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Two reasons. And good ones, too.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Not good ones, please.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Then sure ones.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Then certain ones.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Name them.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Right, and I did, sir. There’s no time to get back hair that’s fallen out.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You didn’t come up with a very good proof.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I knew you’d come up with a bald“Bald” can also mean “trivial” or “lame.”bald conclusion. But wait—who’s that waving to us?']
['ADRIANA', 'Yes, yes, Antipholus: look bewildered and frown at me. You’ve given away all your sweet looks to some other woman—I am not Adriana nor your wife. There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it. How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself? I say yourself because you are a stranger to me now, but when we are indivisible and united in one body, I am better than the best part of you. Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me! For you should know, my love, that it would be as easy to let a drop of water fall into the churning sea and then fish it out again, unmingled and undiminished, as it would be to take yourself from me without taking me out of myself as well. How deeply would it cut you if you heard that I had been cheating on you and that my body—which is sworn for you only—had been contaminated by vile lust?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Are you talking to me, fair woman? I don’t know you. I’ve only been in Ephesus for two hours. Your talk is as strange to me as your town. I’m trying with all my wits to figure out what you mean, but I can’t understand a word of it.']
['LUCIANA', 'Shame on you, brother-in-law! You’ve changed so much! Why are you treating my sister like this? She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Dromio?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Me?']
['ADRIANA', 'You. And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Did you talk with this woman? What kind of scheme do you have going together?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Me, sir? I never saw her till now.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You liar! You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I never talked with her in my life.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Then how does she know our names? By magic?']
['ADRIANA', 'How distasteful! That a man of your stature would scheme with his servant to upset me like this. It may be my fault that you’ve been avoiding me, but don’t make things worse by treating me with contempt as well. I’ll hang on your sleeve: you’re an elm tree, my husband, and I’m a vine. My weakness is enhanced by your strength, which gives me the strength to say this: the things that take you away from me are worthless—just overgrown weeds in need of a trimming. They get into your system and infect you, feeding off your confusion.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'She’s talking to me. She’s talking about me. What, was I married to her in a dream? Or am I asleep now and imagining all this? What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely? Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her.']
['LUCIANA', 'Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Oh, I wish I had my rosary! I’ll cross myself. This must be some kind of fairyland. Oh, spite of spites! We’re']
['LUCIANA', 'Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you? Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I think your mind has been altered, and mine too.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Your body looks the same.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'No, I’m an apeape = a counterfeit (of myself); a foolape.']
['LUCIANA', 'If you’ve changed into anything, it’s an ass.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'That’s true. She’s riding me hard, and all I want to do is get out of here. I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me.']
['ADRIANA', 'All right, all right. I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me. Come, husband, let’s go to lunch. Dromio, guard the door. Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled. SirrahSirrah = term of address for a person of low social standingSirrah, if anyone asks where your master is, say he’s out to lunch, and don’t let anyone come in. Come, sister. Dromio, do a good job as doorkeeper.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell? Asleep or awake? Crazy or sane? These people know me, but I don’t']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Master, should I watch the door?']
['ADRIANA', 'Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head.']
['LUCIANA', 'Come come, Antipholus. We’re late for lunch.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Signior Angelo, please excuse us. My wife gets angry when I’m late. Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow. But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house. You drunkard, what was that all about?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Say what you want, but I know what I know. You beat me at the marketplace, and I have the bruises to prove it. If my skin were paper and your punches were ink, you could read the beating on my body.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I think you’re an ass.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Honestly, it sure looks that way, judging by all the beatings and the bad treatment I’m getting. Since I’m an ass, I ought to kick like one. Then you’d be scared of me and keep away.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Signior Balthasar, you look upset. I hope the good meal I’m going to give you will show the goodwill I bear you and how welcome you are.']
['BALTHASAR', 'Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Signior Balthasar, all the welcome in the world can’t compare to a good meal, whatever kind of food it might be.']
['BALTHASAR', 'Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word.']

Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, it’s possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! We’re so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside.

['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Well, sir, stop your joking there. Are any ships leaving tonight? Can we go?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship Expedition was leaving tonight, but then the officer got you, and you decided to wait for the little rowboat Delay. Here’s the bail money you sent me to get.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world. Please, somebody, get us out of here!']
['COURTESAN', 'Good to see you, Master Antipholus. I see you’ve met with the jeweler. Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Get away from me, Satan! Don’t try to tempt me!']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Master, is this Satan’s mistress?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'She’s the devil.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench. And that’s why some women say, “God damn me,” which is the same thing as saying, “God make me an easy wench.” The Bible says the devil looks like an angel of light. But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you. In other words, easy wenches will burn you. Keep away from this one.']
['COURTESAN', 'You and your servant are very funny, sir. Will you come with me? Can we finish our lunch?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Why, Dromio?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Because of the old saying: “He who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon.” You need to keep far away from them.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', '(to COURTESAN) Get away, you demon! You talk about eating? You’re a sorceress, like everyone else here. I’ll conjure you, like a spell: get away from me.']
['COURTESAN', 'Give me back the ring I gave you at lunch, or give me the necklace you promised in exchange. Then I’ll be gone, sir, and stop troubling you.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Some devilsIn Revelation 20:1, an angel descends from heaven with a chain to bind the devil with.devils ask for nothing more than nail clippings, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, or a cherry pit. But this one’s greedy: she wants a necklace. Be wise, master. If you give it to her, she’ll shake the chain and frighten us, like the angel in the Bible.']
['COURTESAN', 'Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace. I hope you’re not trying to cheat me.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Be gone, witch! Come, Dromio, let’s go.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Accusing us of cheating is like the proud peacock accusing someone else of pride. Mistress, you know about that.']
['COURTESAN', 'Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it. If not, he’d never behave like this. He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it. Now he won’t give me either. The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house. His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having. I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring. It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape. When it’s time for me to be freed, I’ll pay you the fee you’re entitled to for arresting me. My wife’s in a perverse mood today. She’ll be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested. I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Yes. And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'But where’s the money?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'You idiot! Five hundred ducats for a rope?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Why did I just send you home?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'To get a piece of rope. And here I am, with that piece.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS) ']
['OFFICER', 'Good sir, calm down.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'You should tell me to calm down—I’m the one who’s suffering here.']
['OFFICER', 'Hold your tongue.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No, you should tell him to hold his hands!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'You son of a bitch, senseless villain!']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears. I’ve served this man from the moment I was born until this very instant, and all I’ve ever gotten from him are bruises. When I’m cold, his beatings keep me warm. When I’m hot, they keep me cool. He wakes me up by beating me, makes me stand by beating me, sends me out of the house and welcomes me back by beating me. Seriously, I carry beatings around with me like a beggar woman carries her baby. I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'That’s enough. My wife’s coming.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death! Or as the parrot says: “Beware of the rope’s end,” and watch out for a hanging.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Are you going to keep talking? (beats DROMIO OF']
['COURTESAN', 'Now what do you think? Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?']
['ADRIANA', 'This terrible behavior proves it. Doctor Pinch, you’re an exorcist. If you can bring him back to his senses, I’ll pay you whatever you demand.']
['LUCIANA', 'Alas, how passionate and angry he looks!']
['COURTESAN', 'Look! He’s trembling in his fit!']
['PINCH', 'Give me your hand. Let me take your pulse.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Here’s my hand. Let it feel your ear. (he strikes PINCH) ']
['PINCH', 'Satan! You are living inside this man! I order you to release him through my prayers and to return immediately to the darkness you came from. I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Shut up, you doddering old wizard! I’m not possessed!']
['ADRIANA', 'Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers? Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?']
['ADRIANA', 'Oh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home. I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Ate at home? You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And she screamed at me, right?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No lie—she screamed at you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'She sure did. The kitchen girl mocked you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And I departed in a rage, right?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'You truly did. My body can prove it because it felt the power of your anger.']
['ADRIANA', ' (to PINCH) Should I try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies?']
['PINCH', 'Good idea. His servant here has figured out that agreeing is a good way to cope with his anger.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', ' (to ADRIANA) You convinced the jeweler to arrest me.']
['ADRIANA', 'For goodness sake, I sent money to bail you out. I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'You gave money to me? She might have given me her best wishes, master, but she didn’t give me one scrap of money.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats?']
['ADRIANA', 'He did, and I gave it to him.']
['LUCIANA', 'And I saw her do it.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I was sent for a rope! God and the rope maker are my witnesses!']
['PINCH', 'Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed. I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look. We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', ' (to ADRIANA) Tell me! Why did you lock me out today? (to DROMIO OF EPHESUS) And why are you denying that you received the gold?']
['ADRIANA', 'My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'And my sweet master, I received no gold. But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.']
['ADRIANA', 'You lying villain! Both those statements are false.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'You lying slut, everything you say is false. You’re scheming with some damned gang, trying to make a fool of me. With my own bare hands, I’ll scratch out your eyes, which want to see me humiliated.']
['ADRIANA', 'Tie him up! Tie him up! Keep him away from me!']
['PINCH', 'We need more help! The devil in him is strong!']
['LUCIANA', 'Oh, my, poor man! How pale and listless he looks!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Are you trying to kill me? jailer, i’m your prisoner. are you going to let them break me out of jail?']
['OFFICER', 'Gentlemen, let go of him. He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him.']
['PINCH', 'Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.']
['ADRIANA', 'What are you doing, you stupid officer? Do you take some kind of pleasure in seeing a sick man harm himself?']
['OFFICER', 'He’s my prisoner. If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself.']
['ADRIANA', 'I’ll pay you. Take me to the man my husband is in debt to. Once I find out what the debt is for, I’ll pay it. Doctor Pinch, please have him brought to my house. What a horrible day!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'What a horrible slut!']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Master, I’m all tied up for you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Shut up already, you scoundrel! Why are you trying to provoke me?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'You’d rather be tied up for nothing? Act insane, good master: scream out, “The devil!”']
['LUCIANA', 'Oh my God! The poor souls—how strangely they talk!']
['ADRIANA', 'Get him out of here. Sister, come with me.']
['OFFICER', 'Angelo, the jeweler. Do you know him?']
['ADRIANA', 'I know him. How much does my husband owe?']
['OFFICER', 'Two hundred ducats.']
['ADRIANA', 'For what?']
['OFFICER', 'For a necklace your husband had him make.']
['ADRIANA', 'He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.']
['COURTESAN', 'Today your husband came to my place, completely furious. He took my ring, which I just saw on his finger, by the way. Right after that, I saw him with a necklace.']
['ADRIANA', 'Maybe so, but I never saw it. Jailer, bring me to the jeweler. I need to hear the truth about all this.']
['LUCIANA', 'God have mercy on us! They broke loose!']
['ADRIANA', 'And they’ve got their swords unsheathed! Let’s call for help and get them tied up again!']
['OFFICER', 'Let’s get out of here! They’ll kill us!']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'It looks like these witches are scared of swords.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Go to the Centaur and get our stuff. I wish we were safely on board our ship already.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Look, let’s stay here tonight. Nobody will hurt us. You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold. I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town. Go and get our stuff onto the ship.']
['ANGELO', 'I’m sorry that I delayed you, sir. But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?']
['ANGELO', 'People think very highly of him. The merchants give him unlimited credit. He’s well beloved, second to none in the city. I’d trust him with everything I own.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'Speak more quietly: I think he’s coming this way.']
['ANGELO', 'You’re right. And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have! Good sir, stay close to me. I’ll speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I can’t believe you’d put me to this kind of shame and trouble—not to mention the scandal you’ve brought on yourself. You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now you’re wearing it openly. Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but you’ve also mistreated this honest friend of mine. If it hadn’t been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea. You got that necklace from me: can you deny that?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I got it from you—I never said I didn’t.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'Yes, you did, sir. In fact, you swore it.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'Who heard me do that?']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'My own ears heard it, and you know it. To hell with you! It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You’re a villain to say this about me. I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'I do dare, and I say that you are the villain.']
['ADRIANA', ' (to SECOND MERCHANT) Wait! Don’t hurt him, for God’s sake! He’s crazy! Somebody approach him and take away his sword. Tie up Dromio, too, and take them to my house.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Run, master, run. For God’s sake, find a house to duck into. This looks like an abbey. Go in, or we’re done for.']
['ABBESS', 'Be quiet, people! Why have you come here in such a mob?']
['ADRIANA', 'To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there. Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.']
['ANGELO', ' (to SECOND MERCHANT) I knew he wasn’t quite in his right mind.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', ' (to ANGELO) Now I’m sorry I raised my sword against him.']
['ABBESS', 'How long has he been possessed like this?']
['ADRIANA', 'This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self. But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.']
['ABBESS', 'Did he lose a lot of money in a shipwreck? Has a close friend of his died? Has he fallen in love with another woman? That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander. Which of these bad things happened to him?']
['ADRIANA', 'None of them, except the last one. He fell in love, and that made him leave home often.']
['ABBESS', 'You should have reprimanded him for that.']
['ADRIANA', 'I did.']
['ABBESS', 'Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.']
['ADRIANA', 'I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady.']
['ABBESS', 'You scolded him in private?']
['ADRIANA', 'And in public too.']
['ABBESS', 'Fine, but not enough.']
['ADRIANA', 'It was all we talked about. I kept him awake at night talking about it. He couldn’t eat without me talking about it. When we were alone, it was the only thing I talked about, and when we were with other people, I often found a way to mention it. All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.']
['ABBESS', 'And that’s why he went crazy. A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog. You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why he’s disoriented. You seasoned his food with screams. Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever. Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness. You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people can’t enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholy—they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed. Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out. Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad. What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.']
['LUCIANA', 'She was always gentle when she scolded him, even when he behaved in the worst and wildest ways. (to ADRIANA) Why won’t you defend yourself against this woman?']
['ADRIANA', 'She has tricked me into seeing my own faults. Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.']
['ABBESS', 'Nobody goes into my house!']
['ADRIANA', 'Then have your servants bring him out.']
['ABBESS', 'No: he came here for sanctuaryIn Shakespeare’s period, people who sought protection in churches and other holy places were considered outside the reach of the law.sanctuary, and that will protect him from you. I’ll try to bring him back to his right mind and work to the end of my abilities to do so.']
['ADRIANA', 'It’s my place to take care of my husband and nurse him back to health. It is my duty and mine alone. So let me take him home.']
['ABBESS', 'Be patient. I’m not going to let him leave until I’ve tried every means to cure him. With my healthful potions, drugs, and holy prayers, I’ll make him a complete man again. Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs. Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.']
['ADRIANA', 'I will not depart and leave my husband here. It doesn’t suit your holiness to separate a husband and his wife.']
['ABBESS', 'Be quiet and depart. You’re not going to take him.']
['LUCIANA', 'Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.']
['ADRIANA', 'Come with me. I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', "It’s almost five o'clock. The duke will pass by here soon. He always passes here on his way to that melancholy place where criminals are put to death. It’s just behind this abbey."]
['ANGELO', 'Why is he going there today?']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus.']
['ANGELO', 'Here they come. We will watch the execution.']
['LUCIANA', 'Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.']
['DUKE', 'One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death. This is how well we regard him.']
['ADRIANA', 'Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.']
['DUKE', 'She’s a virtuous and holy lady. She can’t possibly have done you any wrong.']
['ADRIANA', 'Your Highness, you were the one who introduced me to my husband, Antipholus, and suggested I marry him. On this terrible day, a most outrageous fit of madness possessed him. It made him run desperately through the streets with his servant, who is just as mad. He angered all the citizens by rushing into their houses and taking rings, jewels, and anything else he felt like. At one point I managed to get him tied up and sent home so that I could make some order out of all the trouble he caused. But somehow, he broke free from his guards. Then he and his crazy servant found us and chased us away with swords. We got more help and came back to capture them, but then they fled into this abbey. We tried to go in, but the abbess stopped us. She wouldn’t let us get him and she wouldn’t send him out. So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.']
['DUKE', 'A long time ago your husband was a soldier in the wars I led. And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.']
['MESSENGER', 'Mistress! Run and save yourself. My master and his servant broke loose. They’ve beaten the maids and tied up Doctor Pinch. Then they set fire to his beard and threw sewage to put out the flames. My master keeps telling the doctor to relax, while his servant cuts the doctor’s hair in a ridiculous fashion. If you don’t send some help, they’ll kill Doctor Pinch.']
['ADRIANA', 'Shut up, fool! Your master and his servant are here. You’re telling a lie.']
['MESSENGER', 'Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true. It was just moments ago. He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.']
['DUKE', ' (to ADRIANA) Stand with me. Don’t be scared. (to his men) Guards, get your weapons!']
['ADRIANA', 'Oh, my, it’s my husband. Look, he can become invisible. Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there. It’s impossible to understand.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Justice, gracious duke. Please bring me justice! A long time ago I did good service to you. I fought in your wars and took deep wounds to save your life. In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.']
['EGEON', ' (to himself) The fear of death might be making me senile, but I think I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Sweet prince, I want justice from that woman there. This woman that you urged me to marry has abused me and dishonored me, doing the most injury possible. The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.']
['DUKE', 'Tell me the details. You know I’ll be fair.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.']
['DUKE', 'That’s terrible! (to ADRIANA) Tell us, woman, did you do that?']
['ADRIANA', 'No, my good lord. I ate with him and my sister. Damn my soul if these accusations are true!']
['LUCIANA', 'If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.']
['ANGELO', 'Oh, lying woman! Both of them are liars: the madman accuses them justly.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'My lord, I know what I’m saying. I’m not drunk, and I haven’t gone mad from anger—even though the wrongs done to me today would drive any man insane. This woman locked me out of the house today at lunchtime, and if he weren’t conspiring with her, this jeweler could confirm my story since he was with me at the time. He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar. He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him. I met him in the street—he was there with that man. (points to the SECOND MERCHANT) ']
['ANGELO', 'Your Highness, I can confirm this much: he was locked out of his house and didn’t eat at home.']
['DUKE', 'But did he receive a necklace from you?']
['ANGELO', 'He did, my lord. And when he ran in here, everyone could see that he was wearing that necklace.']
['SECOND MERCHANT', 'Besides, I’ll swear I heard you confess that you did receive the necklace, even after you swore at the marketplace that you hadn’t. That’s when I raised my sword against you, and you fled into this abbey—which, I think, you must have escaped from through some kind of trick.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I was never inside this abbey, and you never raised your sword against me. I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven! Everything you charge me with is untrue.']
['DUKE', 'Why, what a complicated case this is! I think you all must have drunk some kind of potion that’s turned you all into animals. (to ADRIANA) If you put him in the abbey, that’s where he’d be. If he were insane, he wouldn’t be pleading his case so sensibly. You say he']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.']
['COURTESAN', 'He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.']
['DUKE', 'Did you see him enter this abbey?']
['COURTESAN', 'As clearly as I see you, my lord.']
['DUKE', 'This is very odd. Get the abbess out here. I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad.']
['EGEON', 'Mighty duke, please allow me to say something. I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.']
['DUKE', 'Feel free to say what you wish, Syracusian.']
['EGEON', ' (to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Isn’t your name Antipholus? And isn’t that Dromio, the man bound to you?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes. Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him.']
['EGEON', 'I’m sure you both remember me.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Actually, it’s ourselves you bring to mind since just a few moments ago we were tied up, as you are now. You’re not one of Pinch’s patients, are you, sir?']
['EGEON', 'Why are you looking at me so strangely? You know me well.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I never saw you before in my life.']
['EGEON', 'Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me. Time has the power to deform people, and the sorrowful hours I have spent in his company have put these strange lines and wrinkles on my face. But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'No.']
['EGEON', 'Don’t you, Dromio?']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No sir, trust me, I do not.']
['EGEON', 'I am sure you do.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'Fine, sir, but I’m sure I don’t. And you’re in no position to doubt my word.']
['EGEON', 'You don’t know my voice? Oh, severe Time! Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice? It’s true: this aged face of mine is hidden by a snow white beard, and the blood is freezing in my veins. But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little. All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I never saw my father in my life.']
['EGEON', 'You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse. Maybe you’re ashamed to admit that you know me because I’m a prisoner now.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'The duke and everyone who knows me in this city can confirm that’s not true. I’ve never been to Syracuse in my life.']
['DUKE', 'I tell you, Syracusian. I’ve been looking after Antipholus for twenty years, and during that time he’s never been to Syracuse. Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.']
['ABBESS', 'Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly!']
['ADRIANA', 'Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.']
['DUKE', ' (looks at the ANTIPHOLUS twins) One of these men is the other’s genius. (looks at the DROMIO twins) And the same with these two. But which is the man and which is the spiritgenius = attendant spirit, believed to follow a person throughout his lifespirit? Can anyone tell?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'I, sir, am Dromio. Command this man to leave.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'You are Egeon, aren’t you? Or are you his ghost?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?']
['ABBESS', 'Whoever tied him up, I will loosen the ropes, and with his freedom I will gain a husband. Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons? Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!']
['DUKE', 'Why, now the story the merchant told me this morning is starting to make sense. These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.']
['EGEON', 'If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia. If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.']
['ABBESS', 'Some men from Epidamnum rescued me, our son, and Dromio. But then a gang of violent fishermen from Corinth kidnapped Dromio and my son and carried them away. I don’t know what became of them. You can see what became of me.']
['DUKE', 'Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'No, sir. I came from Syracuse.']
['DUKE', 'Wait, don’t stand next to each other. I can’t tell who’s who.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I came from Corinth, Your Highness.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'And I came with him.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.']
['ADRIANA', 'Which of you two ate lunch with me today?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I did, kind lady.']
['ADRIANA', 'And you’re my husband, right?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'No, he’s not. I say no to that.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'So do I, although she called me her husband. And this beautiful gentlewoman, her sister, called me brother. (to LUCIANA) If all this is for real, I hope I’ll get the chance to make good on all the things I said to you today.']
['ANGELO', 'That’s the necklace I gave you, sir.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I think it is, sir. I don’t deny it.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.']
['ANGELO', 'I think I did, sir. I don’t deny it.']
['ADRIANA', 'I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No, he didn’t get any by me.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me. It seems that we kept running into each other’s servants all day. And everyone thought I was him, and he was me, and that’s how all these errors came about.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'I want to use this money to set my father free.']
['DUKE', 'That’s not necessary. I’m going to let him live.']
['COURTESAN', 'Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.']
['ABBESS', "Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us. Everyone assembled here who has been troubled by the day’s events join us as well, and we will straighten everything out. My sons, waiting to hear news of you has been like a second childbirth: this time, my labor lasted thirty-three years, and I am only now delivered of my heavy burden. Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening. After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!"]
['DUKE', 'With all my heart, I’ll join you.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', ' (to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Master, should I go get your luggage off the ship?']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS', 'Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.']
['ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE', 'He means me. I’m your master, Dromio. Come inside with us: we’ll deal with that later. Embrace your brother there, and rejoice with him.']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you. I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'I think you’re my mirror, not my brother. And I can see by looking at you that I’m a pretty good-looking fellow. Do you want to go in and join the party?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'After you, sir. You’re older than me.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'That’s a good point. How can we tell which of us is the oldest?']
['DROMIO OF SYRACUSE', 'We’ll draw straws. Meanwhile, after you.']
['DROMIO OF EPHESUS', 'No, I’ll tell you what. We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other.']
