His heart                                 used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but                                 now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying                                 the lust of an Egyptian whore.']

Call in the messengers and                                 we’ll find out. As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re                                 blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant. Or that that bitch                                 Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you. Call the                                 messengers!']

My place is here. Kingdoms are only dirt. The soil feeds                                 animals as well as people, so how does having a kingdom separate                                 humans from beasts?

I won’t see any messengers but yours. Tonight                                 we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people. Come, my                                 Queen.

If Cleopatra                                 hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately. I’ve seen her                                 claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason. I                                 think there must be something invigorating about death, since she                                 dies with such enthusiasm.']

She has more                                 storms and tempests in her than a weather almanac. Her temper is not                                 a trick or a skill—if it is, she can make it rain as well as                                 Joveking of the Roman gods; commands thunder, lightning, and rainJove.']
['ANTONY', 'I wish I’d never seen her!']

If Fulvia were the last woman on                                 earth, there would be a reason to grieve. But in this way, grief and                                 comfort appear together. The only kind of tears you should shed in                                 this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your                                 nose. ']

['ANTONY', 'Enough of this frivolous talk. Give our officers notice of our                                 intentions. I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure                                 and get her permission to leave. Fulvia’s death and the pressing                                 concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go;                                 friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.                                 Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar. His fleet controls the sea.                                 Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is                                 over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the                                 Great to his son, Sextus. Sextus has great honor and power, and his                                 spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most                                 formidable soldier in the empire. The empire may be in danger if                                 he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential. There are                                 many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged                                 threats.']

['ANTONY', 'Listen to me, Queen. There is an emergency I must take care of,                                 but my whole heart will remain here with you. My Italy is full of                                 civil war. Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome. When                                 two domestic opponents are equally matched—as we are against                                 Pompey—factions will form on the smallest of pretexts. When a                                 formerly hated man grows powerful, he suddenly finds himself with                                 many supporters. Pompey, who was once condemned, now wields his                                 father’s power, and all the citizens who have grievances against the                                 government are joining him. Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing,                                 and the government is ready to do something desperate. But my                                 personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction                                 my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'I may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth, but I’m not                                 that childishly naïve. Is it possible Fulvia is dead?']

['ANTONY', 'I’ll leave you, lady.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Polite sir, let me say one thing. Sir, you and I must part                                 company—no, that’s not it.

There’s something I’d like                                 to—oh, I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say. Just as Antony has                                 forgotten me. ']
['ANTONY', 'If you weren’t the queen of immaturity, I’d think you were                                 immaturity itself. ']
['CLEOPATRA', 'It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but                                 bear with me. Even the traits that become me most kill me when you                                 don’t approve of them. Your honor is the reason you are leaving. So                                 I beg you not to listen to my foolishness. May the gods be with you.                                 May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. ']
['ANTONY', 'Let’s go. Come with me. Our imminent separation so occupies our                                 thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even                                 though I leave here, I stay with you.']

['CAESAR', 'You’re too forgiving.

That it’s fine to engage in drinking matches                                 with inferiors, or stumble drunkenly through the streets in the                                 middle of the day, or get into fist fights with sweaty servants.                                 Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with                                 a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such                                 antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on                                 while he’s been off amusing himself. If he’s been spending his                                 leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with                                 venereal diseases, and that’s his business. But he’s wasting time                                 and resources vital to our cause and endangering both his position                                 and ours. He should be chastised, like any boy who knows what’s                                 right but chooses to satisfy his desires regardless.']

The young, energetic men are joining Pompey. These                                 pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor, since                                 the simple mention of the name “Pompey” carries as much power as a                                 fleet of troops in battle.']

Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let                                 Antony’s lust combine with both. Keep this libertine occupied with                                 endless debauchery. Keep his brain drunk and his appetite                                 unsatisfied, so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and                                 forgetful of his duties, like the Lethemythical river of the underworld; to drink from it brought forgetfulnessLethe does.']

His military ability is                                 double that of the other two.

['MENAS', 'I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly                                 reunion. Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his                                 brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it.']
['POMPEY', 'Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by                                 greater ones.

They certainly have                                 enough provocation. But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their                                 petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say. It                                 will be as the gods see fit. In any case, our survival depends on                                 putting together the strongest force possible.

If Caesar makes him                                 mad, let Antony stand tall and speak as loudly as Mars, the god of                                 war. By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.

['ANTONY', 'You’re mistaken. My brother didn’t use my name to justify his                                 rebellion. I talked to some reliable participants in that battle. On                                 the contrary, his fight was with both of us. He rejected my                                 authority as much as yours. Since you and I share a common cause,                                 wouldn’t his actions against you be hostile to me as well? I’ve                                 already sent the proof in my letters. If you want to pick a fight,                                 you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.']
['CAESAR', 'You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making                                 up feeble excuses. ']

['ANTONY', 'I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.

I will apologize as much as is                                 appropriate, but my apology will not diminish my great stature—or if                                 I am denied that honor, I will withhold my military might. The truth                                 is that to get me out of Egypt, Fulvia provoked riots here.

Her virtue and grace are unparalleled.

['MAECENAS', ' (to                                      ENOBARBUS ) Welcome back from Egypt, sir.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'You’ve become Caesar’s right hand man, Maecenas! It’s good to see                                 you too, Agrippa.']
['AGRIPPA', 'Good Enobarbus!']
['MAECENAS', 'We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably. And I                                 see you survived your time in Egypt.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Yes, sir, it was tough. We confused the daytime by sleeping                                 through it, and made the night merry with our drinking.']
['MAECENAS', 'We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole                                 for breakfast—for only twelve people! Is that true?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'That was nothing. There were many even more memorable                                 feasts.']
['MAECENAS', 'She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'From the first time Antony saw her, sailing on her barge on the                                 Cydnus RiverRiver in southern Turkey.Cydnus River, he was hers.']
['AGRIPPA', 'She made quite an appearance there, or else my informant invented                                 a very flattering description of her.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I’ll tell you. Her barge looked like a golden throne upon the                                 waves, burning bright with the sun’s reflections. The rear deck was                                 covered with hammered gold. The sails were dyed purple, and they                                 were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with                                 love. The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to                                 flute music. As the oars beat the water, the waves seemed to speed                                 up as if excited by lust. Cleopatra’s appearance was indescribable.                                 As she reclined under a canopy woven from gold thread, she was more                                 beautiful than any artist’s idealized portrait of the goddess Venus.                                 Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and                                 cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames                                 in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they                                 did.']
['AGRIPPA', 'How excellent for Antony!']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Her ladies-in-waiting—like Nereidessea nymphsNereides, or mermaids—tended to                                 Cleopatra as she watched them, and their graceful movements added to                                 the beauty of the scene. It seemed as if a mermaid were steering.                                 The silken sails and ropes swelled in the wind, expertly handled by                                 the ladies’ soft hands. People on the wharves could smell exotic                                 perfume wafting from the barge as it passed them. All the people                                 came out to see her, and Antony, waiting for her in the marketplace,                                 was left alone. Even the air itself would have gone to look at                                 Cleopatra, if that wouldn’t have caused an unnatural vacuum in the                                 atmosphere. ']
['AGRIPPA', 'Extraordinary Egyptian!']
['ENOBARBUS', 'When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to                                 come to supper. She replied by saying that it would be better for                                 him to be her guest instead. Our courteous Antony, who has never                                 said “no” to any woman, after spending plenty of time being groomed                                 by the barber, goes to the feast. For that simple meal, he paid with                                 his heart—even though it was only his eyes that were                                 satisfied.']

['ENOBARBUS', 'I saw her once hop forty feet down the street. When she stopped                                 she was so out of breath that she was panting. Her beauty made even                                 that weakness seem perfect, and even in her breathlessness she                                 seemed to pour out breath.']
['MAECENAS', 'Now Antony has to leave her completely.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'He’ll never leave her. Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so                                 varied that she never grows boring. With other women, the more                                 familiar you grow with them the less appealing they become.                                 Cleopatra, on the other hand, makes you desire her the more you see                                 her. Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her                                 even when she acts the slut.']
['MAECENAS', 'If beauty, wisdom, and modesty can settle Antony’s restless heart,                                 Octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him.']

But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and                                 easily frightened. That’s why there must be space between you.                             ']

I repeat: your                                 angel is afraid to inspire you when you’re around him, but when he                                 goes away it becomes brilliant again. ']

And why                                 did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men                                 devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar? They didn’t                                 want one man to be king in Rome.']
['CAESAR', 'Take your time.']
['ANTONY', 'Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy. We’ll meet you at                                 sea. You know that on land our army is far greater than                                 yours.']
['POMPEY', 'Yes, on land you do outnumber me. Even more since you annexed my                                 father’s house and lands. But since, like the cuckooCuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds’ nests.like the cuckoo, you don’t                                 build anything for yourself, live in those lands as long as you                                 can.']
['LEPIDUS', 'To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our                                 proposal? ']
['CAESAR', 'That’s the point.']
['ANTONY', 'Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the                                 value of our offers.']
['CAESAR', 'And consider the possible consequences of fighting against us, in                                 the hopes of gaining a greater fortune.']

If                                 I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.                             ']

['POMPEY', 'You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept                                 your offer. But Mark Antony made me somewhat angry. (to                                      ANTONY ) Though it would be nobler to for me                                 not to speak of this good act myself, you should know that when                                 Caesar and your brother were fighting, your mother came to Sicily                                 for refuge. I welcomed her gladly. ']
['ANTONY', ' (to                                      POMPEY ) I heard what you did for her,                                 Pompey, and want to give you the many thanks I owe you. ']
['POMPEY', 'Let me shake your hand.']
['ANTONY', 'The East is very seductive. I have you to thank for my trip here;                                 I wouldn’t have left Egypt otherwise, and I have benefited from                                 it.']
['CAESAR', ' (to                                      POMPEY ) You’ve changed since the last time I                                 saw you.']
['POMPEY', 'Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face,                                 but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. ']
['LEPIDUS', 'It’s good we had this meeting.']
['POMPEY', 'I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus. So we are in agreement.                                 Please have the contract written up so we can all sign it.']
['CAESAR', 'That’s the next thing on the agenda.']
['POMPEY', 'We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our                                 separate ways. Let’s draw lots to see who will host the first                                 one.']
['ANTONY', 'I’ll give the first one, Pompey.']
['POMPEY', 'No, Antony. Pick one of these lots. Whether your banquet is first                                 or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best. I heard that                                 Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.']
['ANTONY', 'You’ve heard a lot.']
['POMPEY', 'I mean well, sir.']
['ANTONY', 'I’m sure you do.']
['POMPEY', 'I’ve heard a lot more. I heard that Apollodorus carried—']
['ENOBARBUS', ' (interrupting                                      POMPEY ) That’s enough of that. Yes, it’s                                 true.']
['POMPEY', 'What did he carry, please?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'A certain queen to Caesar, rolled up in a mattressAccording to Plutarch, this is how Cleopatra managed to secretly tryst with Julius Caesar.rolled up in a mattress. ']
['POMPEY', 'Now I know who you are. How are you, soldier?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four                                 feasts are being prepared. ']
['POMPEY', 'Let me shake your hand. I’ve never been your enemy. I’ve seen you                                 fight and envied your skill. ']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when                                 you deserved ten times more praise than I gave. ']
['POMPEY', 'Enjoy your frankness; it suits you. I invite you all aboard my                                 ship. After you, my lords? ']
['CAESAR, ANTONY, AND LEPIDUS', 'Show us the way, sir.']
['POMPEY', 'Come with me.']
['MENAS', ' (to himself) Your                                 father would never have agreed to this treaty, Pompey. (to                                      ENOBARBUS ) You and I have met, sir.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I think it was at sea.']
['MENAS', 'That it was, sir.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'You’ve done well at sea.']
['MENAS', 'And you’ve done well on land.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished                                 on land cannot be denied.']
['MENAS', 'Neither can my accomplishments at sea.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been                                 a great thief at sea.']
['MENAS', 'As you were on land.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny. But let’s                                 shake hands, Menas.']
['MENAS', 'Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'But no beautiful woman has an honest face.']
['MENAS', 'That’s no lie. They steal hearts.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'We came here to fight against you.']
['MENAS', 'For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.                                 Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.']
['MENAS', 'That’s the truth, sir. We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here. Is                                 he married to Cleopatra?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.']
['MENAS', 'That’s true, sir. She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.']
['MENAS', 'Excuse me, sir?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'It’s true.']
['MENAS', 'Then Caesar and he will always be united.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t                                 say that.']
['MENAS', 'I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for                                 love.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I think so too. But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them                                 will be the thing that separates them. Octavia has a pious, chaste,                                 meek disposition.']
['MENAS', 'Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark                                 Antony. He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish. Then Octavia’s                                 complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that                                 brought them together will part them. Antony will go where his                                 passion is. He only married out of political necessity.']
['MENAS', 'Then that’s the way it may turn out. Come on, sir, will you come                                 aboard? I want to drink your health. ']
['ENOBARBUS', 'I’ll join you, sir. We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.']
['MENAS', 'Let’s go.']
['FIRST SERVANT', 'Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor. Some of them are                                 leaning already. It won’t take much for them to fall over.']
['SECOND SERVANT', 'Lepidus is red in the face.']
['FIRST SERVANT', 'They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the                                 poor.']
['SECOND SERVANT', 'Their various personalities grate on one another. Lepidus cries,                                 “No more arguing!” and then when they agree he resigns himself to                                 drink.']
['FIRST SERVANT', 'Which goes on to impede his judgment.']
['SECOND SERVANT', 'That’s what happens when you partner with great men but lack their                                 power. I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than                                 a sword I cannot lift.']
['FIRST SERVANT', 'To be so unimportant in the company of important men is like                                 having a face without any eyes. ']
['ANTONY', 'This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile,                                 according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid. They                                 know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty. The                                 higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest. As the river ebbs,                                 the farmer scatters his seeds on the remaining silt. The harvest                                 comes shortly after that.']
['LEPIDUS', 'Do you have unusual snakes there?']
['ANTONY', 'Yes, Lepidus.']
['LEPIDUS', 'The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud,                                 just like the crocodile.']
['ANTONY', 'Yes, Lepidus.']
['POMPEY', 'Let’s have a seat and some wine. A toast to Lepidus!']
['LEPIDUS', 'I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'Not until you pass out. I’m afraid you’ll keep going until                                 then.']
['LEPIDUS', 'No, I certainly won’t stop. I’ve heard that the pyramids build by                                 the Ptolemies are splendid. Without doubt I’ve heard that.']
['MENAS', ' (aside to                                      POMPEY ) Pompey, could I have a word with                                 you?']

['LEPIDUS', 'What does a crocodile look like?']
['ANTONY', 'Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width. It is                                 only as high as it is and moves with its own legs. It lives on what                                 nourishes it, and when the four elementsfire, air, earth, and water, thought to be the building blocks of all lifethe four elements leave it, its soul moves                                 into another body.

['ANTONY', 'Its own color.']

['POMPEY', ' (aside to                                      MENAS ) I think you’re crazy!']
['MENAS', 'I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.']
['POMPEY', 'You’ve served me faithfully. What else can I say? (to the others) Be                                 happy, lords!']

['POMPEY', 'Oh, you should have done it without telling me! For me to do such                                 a thing would be dishonorable.

We’ve all gotten red in the face. Even the strong Enobarbus                                 isn’t immune to the effects of wine, and I’m tongue-tied myself.                                 This wild party has almost turned us all into clowns. What more need                                 I say? Good night. Good Antony, shake my hand.']

Go                                 after them.

Then our great                                 general, Antony, will commend you. ']
['VENTIDIUS', 'Oh, Silius, Silius, I’ve done enough. A subordinate may exceed his                                 authority. You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave                                 something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s                                 absence. Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating                                 authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.                                 Sossius, an officer that held the same position in Syria as I do                                 here, achieved great distinction very quickly but lost Antony’s                                 support as a result. A man who achieves more in war than his captain                                 does becomes his captain’s rival. Ambition is a good quality in a                                 soldier, but it proves detrimental rather than beneficial when used                                 to surpass his superiors. I could do more to help Antony, but to do                                 so would insult him. And by insulting him, I would lose credit for                                 the good I have done him already. ']
['SILIUS', 'A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your                                 qualities, Ventidius. Are you going to write Antony about                                 this?']

['EROS', 'Caesar used Lepidus in the war, but as soon as it was over,                                 Lepidus was expelled from the triumvirate. He wasn’t allowed any of                                 the glory of the victory, and he was accused of treasonous                                 correspondence with Pompey. On the basis of Caesar’s accusation                                 alone, Lepidus was imprisoned. So the weak third of the triumvirate                                 is imprisoned until death frees him.']
['ENOBARBUS', 'So now the world will only be devoured by two sets of                                 jaws—Caesar’s and Antony’s. And even if you throw everything you                                 possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death                                 to have it all.

He gave Media, Parthia,                                 and Armenia to Alexander. He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to                                 Ptolemy. Cleopatra was dressed like the goddess Isis. They say she                                 often attended her public functions like that. ']

['CAESAR', 'He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’                                 possessions, which we seized in Sicily. Then he says I didn’t return                                 some ships he loaned me.

As for what I seized in the                                 wars, I granted that Antony should have a share. But I also demanded                                 my share of his acquisitions in Armenia and the other conquered                                 kingdoms.']

The trees along the road should have been filled with eager                                 spectators. Crowds should have been faint with excitement waiting to                                 see you. The dust from your attending troops should have risen to                                 heaven. But you’ve arrived like a common maid bringing goods to a                                 Roman market. You’ve kept me from displaying my love—and when love                                 is not shown, it’s often not felt. I would have met you by sea and                                 again by land.

Abandon the person that has abandoned                                 himself. Go to the harbor immediately! I’ll give you the title to                                 that ship and its treasure. Just give me a moment, please—only a                                 moment. I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all                                 before long.']

['DOLABELLA', 'It’s Antony’s schoolmaster. By sending such an insignificant                                 emissary, Antony shows us how low he has sunk.

['AMBASSADOR', 'He acknowledges that you are the master of his fate, and he                                 requests to be allowed to live in Egypt.

That’s all he asks for himself. Cleopatra                                 recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.

['ENOBARBUS', 'Only Antony was at fault. He put his desire in charge of his                                 reason. So what if you ran from the battle, terrified, as ranks of                                 ships threatened one another? Why should he have followed you? With                                 half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for                                 Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him. To race after                                 your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as                                 great as the resulting loss. ']

['ANTONY', 'Is that his answer?']

His treasure, his                                 navy, and his armies might belong to a coward, and his ministers                                 might be able to succeed just as well on behalf of a child as under                                 the command of Caesar. Therefore, I dare him to lay aside his fancy                                 trappings and meet this old man in single combat, sword against                                 sword, just the two of us.

I see that men’s judgments are tied to their                                 fortunes, and that external factors influence a man’s internal                                 qualities, making everything suffer. How could Antony, knowing how                                 luck stood on either side, still imagine that Caesar would respond                                 to his nonsense!

['CLEOPATRA', 'With no more ceremony than that? See, ladies, how they scorn me                                 now. They pinch their noses to avoid smelling the dying rose whose                                 scent, as a bud, they happily inhaled. Show him in, sir.']
['ENOBARBUS', ' (aside) My                                 integrity and I begin to contradict each other. Being loyal to a                                 fool makes loyalty foolish. But a person who can bear to keep his                                 allegiance to a defeated lord defeats his lord’s conqueror and earns                                 a place in history.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'What does Caesar want?']
['THIDIAS', 'It is for your ears only.']

If Caesar chose, Antony would                                 jump at the chance to be his friend. As for us, you know we are                                 Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.']
['THIDIAS', 'So be it. This, then, this is the message Caesar sends to you,                                 famous Queen: he implores you not to be concerned about your                                 situation. Just remember that he is Caesar.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Respectfully put. Go on.']

['THIDIAS', 'So he regrets that any dishonorable acts were forced on you, not                                 being performed of your own free will. ']

['THIDIAS', 'Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him? He almost begs for                                 the opportunity to help you. It would please him very much if you                                 would rely on his wealth and success to support you. But he would                                 feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and                                 put yourself under his protection. ']

['THIDIAS', 'My name is Thidias.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I                                 kiss his conquering hand.

If he doesn’t like what I’ve said or done, remind him                                 that he holds Hipparchus, a slave I freed. He may whip, or hang, or                                 torture him as he pleases. Then we will be even. Recommend that to                                 him. Take your whipping scars and go.']

['ANTONY', 'I am satisfied. Caesar has made camp in Alexandria. I will fight                                 him there. Our land forces have bravely stood firm.

Do you hear what I say, lady? If I                                 come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be                                 covered in blood.

But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to                                 stop me. Come, let’s have one more extravagant night. Invite all my                                 sad captains. Fill our wine bowls again. Let’s drink through                                 midnight.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'It’s my birthday. I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since                                 my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.']

Come on, my                                 Queen. There’s still life in our cause. The next time I fight, I’ll                                 make Death love me. I’ll compete even with his fatal scythe.']

I have always                                 noticed that when my captain’s reason is diminished, his bravery                                 increases. When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only                                 weapon. I’ll look for some way to leave his service.']

Let the old ruffian discover                                 that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh                                 at his challenge.']
['MAECENAS', 'Caesar must realize that when a man as powerful as Antony begins                                 to rage, he has been pursued to the point of collapse.

['CAESAR', 'Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the                                 last we fight.

See that it is done, and                                 prepare a feast for the soldiers. We have enough supplies for it,                                 and they’ve earned it. Poor Antony!']

It’s possible you won’t                                 see me again, or if you do, it will only be my mangled body. Perhaps                                 tomorrow you’ll be serving another master.

['CLEOPATRA', 'The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir. You are my lord                                 and master. I must obey.']
['CAESAR', 'Don’t think I blame you. Whatever injuries I received in the war,                                 I put down to the fortunes of war. ']
['CLEOPATRA', 'You are now the sole lord of the entire world. I can’t explain my                                 cause very clearly. I must admit to having the weaknesses that all                                 women are accused of. ']
['CAESAR', 'Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over                                 you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very                                 compassionate toward you. Your acceptance will benefit you, but if                                 you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I                                 won’t be so generous.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'You may do whatever you want in the world. It’s yours, and you may                                 hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like. Here, my good                                 lord.']

['SELEUCUS', 'Here, madam.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'This is my treasurer. My lord, he will swear on his life that I                                 haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus. ']
['SELEUCUS', 'Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life                                 depends upon it.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'What did I keep for myself?']
['SELEUCUS', 'Enough to buy everything you have declared.']
['CAESAR', 'No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra. You’re very prudent to set a                                 little aside.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Look around you, Caesar. Oh, just see what happens after the                                 pageantry is over! What is mine will be yours now. If we were to                                 change places, what is yours would be mine. Seleucus’ ingratitude                                 makes me wild.

['CAESAR', 'Good Queen, let me implore you—']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed. You condescended to visit me here,                                 honoring my humble self with your lordly presence. And one of my own                                 servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy! Suppose, good                                 Caesar, that I have saved a few feminine trifles, some unimportant                                 trinkets. These have worth only as gifts to friends. And suppose I                                 have kept a few more expensive gifts aside for LiviaOctavius Caesar’s wifeLivia and Octavia, to                                 solicit their good wishes. Must I then be exposed by a person I’ve                                 supported? By the gods! It adds another blow to the many I have                                 already. (to                                      SELEUCUS ) Please leave, or I’ll show you                                 what’s left of my spirit since my fortune was ruined. If you were a                                 real man, you would have had mercy on me. ']
['CAESAR', 'Leave, Seleucus.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'You should also know that as head of state, we are often blamed                                 for the crimes of others. And though we may fall, we are still                                 responsible for their offenses. I am therefore to be pitied.']
['CAESAR', 'Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept                                 back or the ones you listed. It’s all still yours. Do whatever you                                 like with it. You can trust that Caesar is not a merchant to haggle                                 with you over your property. So cheer up. Don’t be captured by your                                 depressed thoughts. No, dear Queen. We want to follow your own                                 counsel when making arrangements for you. Eat and sleep. I have so                                 much care and pity for you that you could call me friend. And so,                                 good-bye.']

Within three days you and your children will be sent ahead.                                 Make the best use of this information you can. I have done your                                 bidding and fulfilled my promise. ']

Disreputable minstrels will write bawdy songs about                                 us. Hotheaded comedians will stage impromptu impersonations of us                                 and depict the celebrations we had in Alexandria. Antony will be                                 portrayed as a drunk, and I’ll see some boy with a squeaking voice                                 play Cleopatra as if I were a whore.']
['IRAS', 'Oh, the good gods!']
['CLEOPATRA', 'No, that’s the truth.']

And after you’ve done this chore, I’ll give you permission to amuse                                 yourself until doomsday.

['CLEOPATRA', 'Do you remember anyone who died of it?']
['COUNTRYMAN', 'Many people, men and women alike. I heard of one just yesterday.                                 She was a very honest woman but rather inclined to lie—which a woman                                 shouldn’t do unless she’s protecting her reputation. I heard how she                                 died of its bite, how much pain she felt. Indeed, she gives a very                                 good testimony of the snake’s power. But if you believe everything                                 they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do. But this is a                                 sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'You may leave now. Farewell.']
['COUNTRYMAN', 'I hope you are pleased with the snake.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Farewell.']
['COUNTRYMAN', 'You must know that the snake will act according to his                                 nature.']

['COUNTRYMAN', 'Listen, the snake is dangerous unless handled by people who are                                 used to him. There isn’t any kindness in the snake.']

['COUNTRYMAN', 'Good. Don’t feed it, I beg you. It’s not worth feeding. ']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Will it eat me?']
['COUNTRYMAN', 'Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself                                 won’t eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish fit only for the                                 gods, as long as the devil hasn’t prepared the meal. But devils                                 cause a lot of trouble for the gods regarding their women. For every                                 ten women the gods make, the devils ruin five.']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Well, you can go now. Farewell.']

['CHARMIAN', 'Oh, eastern star!']
['CLEOPATRA', 'Quiet, quiet! Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that                                 its nurse will fall asleep? ']

['SECOND GUARD', 'There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar. Call him.']
['FIRST GUARD', 'What kind of work is this, Charmian? Is this well done?']
['CHARMIAN', 'It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended                                 from so many royal kings. Ah, soldier!']
['DOLABELLA', 'What’s going on in here?']
['SECOND GUARD', 'They’re all dead.']
['DOLABELLA', 'Caesar, you thought this would happen. You’re coming here yourself                                 to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.']
['ALL', 'Step aside, step aside for Caesar!']
['DOLABELLA', 'Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future. What you were                                 afraid of has happened.']
['CAESAR', 'She was bravest at the end. She knew what I intended to do with                                 her and, being royal, she took her own way out. How did they die? I                                 don’t see any blood. ']
['DOLABELLA', 'Who was with them last?']
['FIRST GUARD', 'A simple country farmer who brought her figs. This was the                                 basket.']
['CAESAR', 'They were poisoned, then.']
['FIRST GUARD', 'Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago. She stood and                                 spoke. I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress. She                                 stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead. ']
['CAESAR', 'Oh, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, it would be                                 evident by external swelling. But she looks like she’s asleep, as if                                 she would charm another Antony.']
['DOLABELLA', 'Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark. There’s a similar                                 mark on her arm. ']
['FIRST GUARD', 'This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them,                                 just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the                                 Nile.']
['CAESAR', 'That’s probably how she died. Her doctor told me she had searched                                 for an infinite number of easy ways to die. Pick up her bed and                                 carry her ladies out of the tomb. She shall be buried next to her                                 Antony. No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.                                 Momentous events like these strike those that cause them. Antony and                                 Cleopatra’s story is as pitiable as my military exploits are                                 glorious. Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then                                 depart for Rome. Come, Dolabella. See that there is a dignified                                 splendor to this great solemnity.']
