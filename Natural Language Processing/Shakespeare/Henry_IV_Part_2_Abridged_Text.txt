['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Hello? Who’s the doorman around here?']
['PORTER', 'Who shall I say you are?']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Tell the Earl that the Lord Bardolph is here to see him.']
['PORTER', 'His lordship is out walking in the orchard. If you don’t mind, knock at the orchard gate and he’ll answer it himself.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Here comes the Earl.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'What’s the news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute, new violence erupts; it is a wild time. Conflict is like a horse, fed with too much rich food: it has broken out uncontrollably, and tramples everyone who stands before it.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Noble Earl, I have reliable news from Shrewsbury.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'Good news, God willing.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'As good as one could wish for. The King has been wounded and is near death. And, thanks to your son’s luck, Prince Harry has been killed. Douglas killed both Lords Blunt. Prince John of Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Stafford fled the battlefield. And your son captured that hulking Sir John Falstaff, Prince Harry’s fattened pig. Oh, there hasn’t been a battle so well fought or a victory so well won since the days of Julius Caesar! It brings honor to our times.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'How do you know all this? Did you see the battlefield? Did you come from Shrewsbury?']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'I talked with someone, my lord, who was coming from there. He was a gentleman, with good breeding and a good reputation. He swore that all this was the truth.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'Here comes my servant, Travers. I sent him last Tuesday to find out what was happening.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Sir, I passed him on my way here. He doesn’t know anything more than what I told him.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'Now Travers, what good news do you have?']
['TRAVERS', 'Sir, LordMany critics believe that the “Sir John Umfrevile” in Shakespeare’s text is a textual error, an accidental leftover from an early draft, and that Travers is actually referring to Bardolph.Lord Bardolph told me happy news and I turned around, to come back here. But he had a faster horse, so he passed me and got here first.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'What? Say that again: he said that Harry Percy’s spur was cold? Hotspur is now “Coldspur?” That the rebels had bad luck?']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'My lord, I’ll tell you what—if your son hasn’t won, on my honor, I’ll exchange all my land for a lace to tie stockings with; don’t even say such a thing.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'But why would that gentleman who rode past Travers describe such examples of loss?']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Who, him? He was some insignificant nobody who stole the horse he was riding and, I bet my life, was just talking nonsense. Look, here comes another messenger.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'Yes. And the look on his face is like the title page of a book: it hints at the tragic story within. His brow is lined with furrows, like a beach after a wild flood. Morton, did you come from Shrewsbury?']
['MORTON', 'I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord. Death was there, frightening our side with his ugliest mask.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'How are my son and my brother? You’re trembling, and the paleness of your face is more likely to convey your news than your tongue. This is like that old story about the burning of Troy. A man like you—faint, lifeless, dull, deadly-looking, sad—woke King Priam in the dead of night to tell him that half the city of Troy had been burned down. But Priam saw the fire before this man could speak, and I can see my Percy’s death before you report it. You’re going to tell me, “Your son did such-and-such; your brother did this; the noble Douglas fought like so.” You’ll stuff my greedy ears with stories of their bold deeds. But in the end, you’ll stop my ears forever with a sigh that blows away all your words of praise. You will end your story by saying, “Your brother, your son, everyone-dead.”']
['MORTON', 'Douglas is alive, and so is your brother, for now. But as for your son, my lord—']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'Why, he is dead. My suspicion is so quick to speak! When a man fears something, and doesn’t want to know the truth, he can still tell when that thing has happened; by instinct, he can read it in another man’s eyes. But speak, Morton. Tell me, who am an earl, that I have']
['MORTON', 'You are too great a man to be slandered by me. Your instinct is correct; your fears are true.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'But despite all this, don’t say that Percy’s dead. I can see a strange sort of confession in your eyes. You shake your head; you’re afraid to tell the truth, or you think it would be sinful. If he’s been killed, say so. The man who reports a death doesn’t offend with that report. To lie about the dead is a sin, but it is no sin to say that a dead man is not alive. It’s a losing situation, being the first man to bring unwelcome news. That man’s voice sounds forever like a sad bell, and it will always be remembered for tolling the death of a friend.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'My lord, I cannot believe your son is dead.']
['MORTON', 'I’m sorry that I must force you to believe this, when I wish to God that I hadn’t seen it myself. But I saw him, in his bloody state, with my own eyes. He was barely able to fight back, exhausted and out of breath. Harry Monmouth’s swift fury beat the unflinching Percy down to the ground, and once he was there, Percy never rose again. To be brief, Percy’s spirit inspired the entire army, down to the dullest peasant. When the news got out that he had been killed, it took the fire and courage away from even the bravest soldiers. Percy’s metal steeled the whole army; when they learned that he had been blunted, they bent and warped like dull, heavy lead.']
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'There will be time to mourn for this. Sometimes poison can be a kind of medicine: this news, which would have made me sick had I been well, has, because I am sick, made me well. A dying man—his joints weakened by fever, dangling like useless hinges and crumpling under the man’s own weight—will sometimes be stuck with a fit of impatience, causing him to burst out of his caretaker’s arms. My limbs are like that now; once weakened by grief, they’re now enraged by grief, and are three times as powerful as they were before. Away from me, you unmanly crutch! Chain mail armor will cover my hands now. Away from me, you invalid’s cap! You are too fanciful a helmet for this head which is now the target of kings, grown arrogant with their victories. Wrap my head in iron, and then attack me with the roughest things that destiny and hatred will dare to bring upon me in my rage. Let the sky come crashing down! Let the ocean overflow the shores! Let law and order die! And let the world no longer be a stage for a long, drawn-out struggle: let the spirit of']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'This extreme passion is bad for you, sir.']
['MORTON', 'Gentle Earl, don’t abandon your wisdom. All your allies are depending on you and your well-being. If you allow yourself to indulge in this kind of stormy emotion, your health will deteriorate even further. Before you said, “Let’s raise an army,” you calculated how the war might end, and you thought carefully about the likeliness of a victory. You knew from the beginning that, once the fighting started, your son might die. You knew that he was treading dangerously, as if on the edge of a precipice: you knew he was more likely to fall over than make it across. You were warned that your son was made of flesh and blood, and that it was possible he’d get hurt. You were warned that his temper and hot-headedness would push him into the most dangerous situations. But you still said, “Go forward.” None of this consideration, even though it was clearly understood, could stop the stubborn course of events. So what happened here? What has been the result of this brave undertaking? Only this: precisely what was likely to happen in the first place.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'We all knew that we were venturing into dangerous waters. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe knew the odds were ten to one that we would come out alive, and yet we ventured forward anyway. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe potential reward of winning outweighed the fear of our probable loss. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t']
['MORTON', "It is the appropriate time. Good sir, I hear for certain, and I tell you truthfully, that the Archbishop of York has raised a powerful army. He motivates his men with both his earthly and his spiritual powers. My lord, your son commanded only his soldiers' bodies. The word “rebellion” frightened them, separating their bodies from their hearts. It caused them to fight timidly, hesitantly, as though they were taking medicine: their weapons seemed to be on our side, but their spirits and souls were frozen, like fish in an icy pond. But now, the Archbishop turns our rebellion into a religious cause. Everyone believes he’s a righteous and holy man, and they follow him not only in body but also in mind. He enhances his cause by preaching about the blood of good King Richard, which was spilled at Pomfret Castle. The Archbishop claims that he derives his authority from heaven; tells the men that the whole country is bleeding, gasping for life under the terrible leadership of Bolingbroke. And so men from every walk of life flock like sheep to follow him."]
['NORTHUMBERLAND', 'I knew all this, but to tell you the truth, this terrible grief had pushed it out of my thoughts. Come inside; I want to hear everyone’s ideas on the best way to defend ourselves and enact our revenge. Send out messengers and letters, and make new allies quickly. Our numbers have never been smaller, but there’s never been more need for what we have to do.']
['FALSTAFF', ' SirrahSirrah = term of address for a person of lower social rankSirrah, you giantFalstaff is mocking the page for being so small.giant, what did the doctor say about my urine?']
['PAGE', 'He said that the urine itself was good, healthy urine, but that the man who owned it probably had more diseases than he could tell.']
['FALSTAFF', 'All kinds of people make it a matter of pride to heckle me. No man—that foolishly assembled lump of clay—could ever invent something quite as funny as I seem to be to other people. I’m not only witty on my own, but I bring out wit in other people. Look at the two of us, walking here: I look like a sow that’s smothered all of her baby pigs, except for you. If the Prince sent you to serve me for any other reason than to irritate me, I’m a fool. You weedy little son of a bitch: you’re so tiny that you should be a decoration on my hat, not a servant at my feet. I’ve never had a servant before who was as tiny as a ring stone. But I won’t set you in a gold or silver ring; I’ll wrap you in rags and send you back to your master, to be used as a jewel—that youth, the Prince your master, whose chin is still lacking a beard. Why, I’ll grow a beard in the palm of my hand before he’ll have one that he can shave off his face. And yet, this doesn’t stop him from claiming that he has a face for royaltyFalstaff puns on the fact that a “royal” was a kind of coin, stamped with the king’s face.royalty. Well, God will give him a beard whenever he chooses to—there’s not a hair out of place yet. It’s a good thing the Prince’s face is a royal, because a barber will never earn a coin from shaving it. And still, the']
['PAGE', 'He said that you have to give him a better guarantee of payment than just saying Bardolph was good for it. He wouldn’t accept Bardolph’s promise or yours; he felt that neither should be trusted.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Damn him to hell then, just like Dives in the Bible—the rich glutton who rejected the beggar Lazarus! And may Dommelton burn even hotter! He’s a son-of-a-bitch traitor! A two-faced liar, who smiles and says “Yes sir, that’ll be fine” to my face, and then demands a guarantee of payment! These bastard shopkeepers, with their fashionable short haircuts, and fancy shoes, and their fat key chains on their belts—you make an agreement to put something on credit, and then they throw a “guarantee of payment” at you. I would rather eat rat poison than guarantee my payment. I expected him to send me twenty-two yards of satin, and instead he sends me a “guarantee of payment.” Well, let him guarantee himself a good night’s sleep. After all, his wife’s in somebody else’s bed, so why not? She’s practically shining a spotlight on her adultery, but he’s so clueless he can’t even tell. Where’s Bardolph?']
['PAGE', 'He went to Smithfield to buy you a horse, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I bought Bardolph at St. Paul’s CathedralUnemployed men waited at St. Paul’s Cathedral to be hired for short-term jobs. The nearby Smithfield was a livestock market; horses bought there were considered cheap nags.St. Paul’s Cathedral, and he’s buying me a horse in Smithfield. Now if he could just find me a wife in a whorehouse, I’d be fully stocked with high-quality servants, horses, and wives.']
['PAGE', 'Sir, here comes the man who put the Prince in jail for hitting him during that argument about Bardolph.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Hide; I don’t want to talk to him.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Who is that man?']
['SERVANT', 'Falstaff, if it please you, sir.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'The man who was a suspect in that robbery?']
['SERVANT', 'That’s the one. But he did good work in the Battle of Shrewsbury, and I hear he’s taking some soldiers to help Lord John of Lancaster.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Where, to York? Tell him to come here.']
['SERVANT', 'Sir John Falstaff!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Boy, tell him I’m deaf.']
['PAGE', 'You have to speak up; my master is deaf.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I’m sure he is, when anything good’s being said. Go, tap him on the shoulder. I must speak with him.']
['SERVANT', 'Sir John!']
['FALSTAFF', 'What? A young troublemaker? A beggar? Isn’t there a war on? Isn’t there work to do? Doesn’t the King need subjects? Don’t the rebels need soldiers? Though it’s shameful to be on any side but the King’s, it’s even more shameful to be an idle beggar than a soldier on']
['SERVANT', 'You’re mistaken, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Why is that? Did I say you were an honest man? Because, setting aside the fact that I’m knight and a soldier, I’d be nothing but a liar if I said that.']
['SERVANT', 'Then please, sir, set aside your knighthood and your soldiership and let me tell you that you’re a deliberate liar, if you say I’m anything other than an honest man.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Should I allow you to say that? Should I set aside something that’s mine by right? If I allow you anything, hang me. If you allow yourself, hang you. You’re running in the wrong direction: get out of here! Go!']
['SERVANT', 'Sir, my master wants to speak with you.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Sir John Falstaff, I’d like a word with you.']
['FALSTAFF', 'My good sir! God grant you a good day! It’s great to see you out and about: I’d heard you were sick. I hope your doctor knows you’re out. Though you’re not entirely past your youth, your lordship, you have a touch of age in you, a touch of the passage of time, and I must humbly urge you to take good care of your health.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Sir John, I sent for you to come see me before you left for Shrewsbury.']
['FALSTAFF', 'If you don’t mind my saying so, I hear the King is back from Wales and it didn’t go so well.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I’m not talking about the King. You didn’t come when I sent for you.']
['FALSTAFF', 'And I also hear that the King has fallen into a terrible paralysis.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Well, God give him a speedy recovery. Please, let me speak with you.']
['FALSTAFF', 'His paralysis is, as I understand it, a kind of lethargy, if it please you. It’s a sleepiness in the blood, a nasty tingling.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Why are you telling me this? Let it be.']
['FALSTAFF', 'It comes from heavy sadness; from too much reading, and too much thinking. I read about it in the reference books: it’s a kind of deafness.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I think you must have that disease as well, because you’re not hearing a word I’m saying.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Very likely, my lord, very likely. But actually, sir, I have the not-listening disease; I have the not-paying-attention sickness.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'The cure for that illness would be to put you in shackles, and I wouldn’t mind being your doctor.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I may be as poor as JobIn the Bible, Job patiently withstood a series of hardships set on him by God.Job, but I’m not as patient. You may be able to throw me in jail because of my poverty, but some people might have slight reservations about that.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I sent for you to come speak with me. There were charges against you that might have earned you the death penalty.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I was advised that, since I was working for the army at the time, I shouldn’t go.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'The truth is, Sir John, that you are massively notorious.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Anybody who wears a belt this big couldn’t be anything less than massive.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Your bank account is thin, and yet you put it to huge waste.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I wish it were the other way around: that my bank account were huge and my waist were thin.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'You’ve misled the young Prince.']
['FALSTAFF', 'The young Prince has misled me. I’m the man with the big belly, and he’s the dog who walks in front of me.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Well, I’d rather not open up a wound that’s just healed. The good work you did at Shrewsbury has made up a little for the bad thing you did at Gad’s Hill. You can thank the rebellion for helping you get away with that terrible deed.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Really?']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'But since things are calm now, let’s keep them that way. We won’t wake a sleeping wolf.']
['FALSTAFF', 'To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a foxsmell a fox = be suspicioussmell a fox.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'What? You’re like a candle, half burned out.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Maybe, if I were a big, fat holiday candle made of animal fat. But you’d be better off saying that I’m a wax candle: I keep “waxing” larger and larger.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Your gray beard should be a sign that you’re a man of gravity.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’m a man of gravy, gravy, gravy.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'You follow the young Prince everywhere, like a false angel on his shoulder.']
['FALSTAFF', 'That’s not so, my lord. False angelsangel = a kind of coin; angels were often trimmed of some of their metal; a defective angel could be distinguished from a proper by weighing it on a scale.angels are light, and anyone can see without having to weigh me that I’m too heavy. But I don’t know; in some ways, you’re right. I’m not for these times. Virtue counts for so little in this commercial world of ours. True courage is worthless; it’s only used by animal trainers in the bear-baiting rings. Intelligence is good for nobody but bartenders, who waste their wits totaling up tavern bills. In these mean-spirited days, man’s best qualities aren’t worth a thing. You older folks don’t value us young people. You measure our fiery passion according to your melancholic bitterness. And I have to tell you, those of us who are highly advanced in our youth, we’re spirited as well as young.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'You’d add your name to the list of the young? You, who have age written all over you? Don’t you have mucus in your eyes? Dry skin? Jaundice? A white beard? An']
['FALSTAFF', "Sir, I was born around three o'clock in the afternoon, with a white head and a bit of a round belly. As for my scratchy voice, I lost it through shouting and singing loud songs. But I won’t try to prove how young I am any longer. I have only one trait of old age, and that is wisdom. If somebody wants to challenge me to a dance contest for a thousand-markmark = unit of currencymark wager, let him hand me the money and off we go. Now, as for the fact that the Prince hit you on the head, he did it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible gentleman. I reprimanded him for it, and he repents. He’s not wearing the traditional sackcloth and ashes, for sure, but he’s repenting in silk cloth and wine."]
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'May God send the Prince a better friend!']
['FALSTAFF', 'May God send the friend a better prince! I can’t get him off my hands!']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Well, the King has separated you and Prince Harry. I hear you’re going with John of Lancaster to go fight Northumberland and the Archbishop.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Yes, and thanks for reminding me. I hope that all of you who stay home, safe and sound, will say a prayer that we soldiers don’t end up in some hot battle. For, by the Lord, I’ve only packed two shirts, and I don’t want to sweat too much. If things get hot and I pull out any other weapon besides a bottle, I’ll never drink wine again. I get sent out on every dangerous assignment']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Well, stay honest, stay honest. God bless your undertaking.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Could your lordship lend me a thousand pounds for some equipment I need?']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Not a penny, not a penny: you’re too impatient to endure adversity. Farewell; give my regards to my kinsman Westmoreland.']
['FALSTAFF', 'If I do, hit me with a sledgehammer. Old age and greed go together like youth and lust. Gout afflicts one and syphilis plagues the other, so there’s no point in me cursing either the old or the young: they’re both cursed already. Boy!']
['PAGE', 'Sir?']
['FALSTAFF', 'How much money’s in my wallet?']
['PAGE', 'About seven groatsgroat = coin worth four pencegroats and two pence.']
['FALSTAFF', 'There no way to cure the illness that’s making my wallet waste away; borrowing makes it live a little longer, but the disease is incurable. Bring this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, this one to the Prince, this one to Westmoreland, and this one to Madame Ursula. I’ve promised to marry her every single week since I got my first gray hair. Get going: you know where I’ll be.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'So that’s what we’re fighting for, and that’s the kind of support we have. Now please, my noble friends, tell me frankly if you think we have a chance. First you, Marshal Mowbray. What do you say?']
['MOWBRAY', 'I absolutely agree with our reasons for fighting. But given our resources, I’d feel better if I knew how we’re going to grow bold and strong enough to defeat this mighty and powerful King.']
['HASTINGS', 'Our army has grown to twenty-five thousand good men. Our reinforcements are coming with Northumberland, and his heart burns with anger over all he’s lost.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Then, Lord Hastings, this is the question: can our twenty-five thousand get the job done without Northumberland?']
['HASTINGS', 'With him, we can.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Yes, exactly, and that’s the point. If we’re too weak without him, then I don’t think we should advance until we know that his help is guaranteed. In a fight as bloody as this one, we need to be certain about the status of our supporters: we can’t rely on conjecture, hope, and guesswork when aid isn’t guaranteed.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'That’s right, Lord Bardolph. That’s what happened to young Hotspur at Shrewsbury.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'That’s true, my lord. Hotspur fortified himself with nothing but hope, and mistook empty words as a true promise of reinforcements. He imagined that a huge army was coming to his aid, but what actually arrived turned out to be even smaller than the smallest of his fantasies. And so, with daydreams that could only belong to a madman, he closed his eyes and leaped into destruction.']
['HASTINGS', 'But, begging your pardon, there’s no harm in making guesses and hopeful strategies.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Yes, there is. Presently, our armies are already in motion, but putting our hope in them is as ridiculous as expecting that early spring buds will produce fruit: at that time of year, buds are more likely to be killed by frost than to bloom. When we want to put up a building, first we survey the land, and then we draw up a set of plans. Then we calculate the cost, and if we can’t afford it, we revise the plans with fewer rooms, or we decide not to build at all. In the great task we’re attempting—the taking down of one kingdom, and the building of another—we have even more reason to evaluate the land and the plans. We must be certain that the foundation is sound, that the engineer is skilled. We must know precisely what we can afford, how ready and able we are, and we must consider the opposing arguments.']
['HASTINGS', 'Let’s suppose that everything we’re hoping for fails to materialize, and the army we have now is as big as it’s going to get. I still think that, even in this condition, we’re a match for the King.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Why? Does the King only have twenty-five thousand men?']
['HASTINGS', 'The King isn’t facing us with any more than that—in fact, he doesn’t even have that many, Lord Bardolph. This is a time of war, and the King’s had to divide his army into three sections. One division is fighting the French; one’s fighting Glendower. That leaves a third of his army to fight against us. The King is weak and divided into three, and the coffers of his treasury echo with the sounds of hollow poverty and emptiness.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'There’s no reason to fear that he will pull all three divisions together and confront us with his full strength.']
['HASTINGS', 'If he did that, he’d be vulnerable at the rear, and the French and the Welsh would be at his heels. He would never let that happen.']
['LORD BARDOLPH', 'Who’s going to lead his troops against us?']
['HASTINGS', 'The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland. The King and Harry Monmouth will fight against the Welsh. I don’t know for sure who is in charge of the fight against the French.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Let’s continue. We’ll publicly proclaim the reasons we’re fighting. The people are sick of the leadership they themselves supported. They were greedy for it, but now they have overfed. When you build your foundation on the public’s love, you build on shaky and unsure ground. Oh, you foolish masses! You shouted your love for Bolingbroke to the skies, before you knew what he’d turn into. Now that you’re dressed in the things you desired, you monstrous devourer, you’re so full of Bolingbroke that you’re ready to vomit him up. This, you vulgar dog, is just how you emptied your gluttonous stomach of King Richard; and now you want to eat up your dead vomit, and you howl trying to find it. What can you count on in this world? The very people who wanted Richard dead when he was alive are now in love with his corpse. The very people who threw garbage on his noble head when he marched through London in shame behind the admired Bolingbroke are now saying, “Oh Earth, return that King, and take this one!” Curses on men’s thoughts! Only the past and the future appeal to them; whatever they have right now they despise.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Should we gather our troops and press forward?']
['HASTINGS', 'Time is our commander, and time proposes we be on our way.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Master Fang, have you filed the lawsuit?']
['FANG', 'It’s filed.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Where’s your deputy? Is he a strong deputy? Will he rise to the occasion?']
['FANG', 'Sirrah, where’s Snare?']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Oh my goodness! Master Snare!']
['SNARE', 'Here, here.']
['FANG', 'Snare, we’ve got to arrest Sir John Falstaff.']

['SNARE', 'It could cost some of us our lives: he’ll stab.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Oh my goodness! Watch out for him: he stabbed me in my own house, and it was nasty. I swear, he doesn’t care what trouble he causes. Once he’s got his weapon out, he’ll thrust it like the devil. He won’t spare man, woman, or child.']
['FANG', 'If I can get close to him, I won’t worry about his thrusting.']

That’s a terrible way to treat people, unless you think that every woman should be made an ass and an animal, and that she should be opened to every jerk’s molestation.

Can you deny it?

But neither your confident demeanor nor the storm of words that accompanies your insolent disrespect will sway me from making a just consideration. As far as I can see, you’ve taken advantage of this trusting woman, and you’ve made her give you cash and other favors.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Yes, truthfully, sir.']

['GOWER', 'I have to attend to this noble man right here. But thank you, Sir John.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Sir John, you’ve been loitering here too long. You have to recruit soldiers in the counties you pass through on your way north.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Will you join me for supper, then, Master Gower?']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'What foolish teacher taught you these manners, Sir John?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Master Gower, if my mannersFalstaff is referencing an earlier part of the scene, when the Chief Justice similarly ignored Falstaff.manners are inappropriate, I must have indeed been taught by a fool. That’s how the game is played—tit for tat, and game over.']

['PRINCE HENRY', 'I swear to God, I’m exceedingly tired.']
['POINS', 'Really? I would have thought that weariness wouldn’t dare afflict someone as highly born as you.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Well, it afflicts me, although saying so dims my nobility somewhat. Does it make me seem coarse and common to say that I’d love a small beersmall beer = a kind of weak, thin beersmall beer?']
['POINS', 'A prince shouldn’t be vulgarly inclined toward things like small beer.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Then I suppose don’t have a prince’s appetite, because right now all I can think about is small beer. But it’s true: all these everyday considerations distance me from my own nobility. It’s disgraceful that I should be familiar with a man like you! To know your name, your face, and your wardrobe so intimately that I know that you have two pairs of stockings: the ones you’re wearing now, and those peach-colored ones. I even know how many shirts you have: one to wear, and one extra. But then, the keeper of the tennis courts knows your wardrobe better than I do, for when you’ve run out of clean shirts, you don’t show up to play. And you haven’t played in a while, because the whore houses have eaten all the rest of your money, which you’d otherwise use to buy more shirts. God only knows whether all the crying brats you’ve fathered will make it to heaven. But then, the midwives say that babies don’t bear the sins of the parents. That’s how the population increases, and families are strengthened.']
['POINS', 'It seems wrong, after all your hard work in battle, that you should be spending your time now in idle chatter. How many other princes would behave like this if their fathers were as sick as yours?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Can I tell you something, Poins?']
['POINS', 'Sure; and make sure it’s an excellent thing.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'It’ll be fine, for people who aren’t any smarter than you are.']
['POINS', 'Go ahead. I’m can take whatever you have to say.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Here it is, then. It’s not seemly for me to be sad over my father’s illness. But I could tell you—as a person who, for lack of anyone else, I’m pleased to call my friend—that I could be sad. I could be very sad, indeed.']
['POINS', 'It would be difficult to feel that way over a thing like this.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'I swear, you must think that I’m as sinful as you and Falstaff are, and as stubborn and persistent. We’ll see about that. But I’m telling you: my heart is bleeding for my father, and for his illness. But because I’m hanging out with lowlifes like you, I can’t show how sorrowful I am.']
['POINS', 'Why?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'What would you think of me if I started crying?']
['POINS', 'I would think you’re a royal hypocrite.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'That’s what everyone would be thinking. And what’s great about you is that you think just the way everyone else does: nobody sticks to popular opinion quite as well as you. Everyone would think I was a hypocrite, indeed. And, your honor, what makes you think that?']
['POINS', 'Because you’ve behaved so badly, and because you’re so attached to Falstaff.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'And to you.']
['POINS', 'Honestly, people think highly of me; I hear their praises with my own ears. The worst thing they can say about me is that, as a younger brother, I’ve had no inheritance from my family, and that I’m a good fighter. And I can’t help either of those things. By God, here comes Bardolph.']

['BARDOLPH', 'If between the three of you this boy doesn’t end up hanged, the gallows will be cheated.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'How’s your master Falstaff doing, Bardolph?']
['BARDOLPH', 'Fine, sir. He heard you were coming to town. Here’s a letter for you.']
['POINS', 'Delivered very respectfully. How is that fattened calf, your boss?']
['BARDOLPH', 'His body’s healthy, sir.']
['POINS', 'That’s right, it’s just his immortal soul that needs a doctor. But he doesn’t care. His soul may be sick, but it won’t die.']

['POINS', ' (reads) “John Falstaff, knight”—he always throws that title around, every chance he gets.

['PRINCE HENRY', 'Right. They all say they’re related to us, even if they have to trace the family tree all the way back to Japhet, the common ancestor of all Europeans. But back to the letter.

Two honors were lost in that battle: yours, and your son’s. As for yours, I hope God will make it shine again. As for Harry’s honor, it clung to him like the sun in a pale blue sky, and by its light every knight in England was moved to act bravely. He was the mirror in which noble youths dressed themselves.

['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Please, Jack, please; don’t fight!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Get downstairs! (he draws his sword and chases PISTOL) ']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'This is going to be some fight! I would sooner close this bar than put up with terrors and fits. It’s murder, I swear! Oh my! Oh my! Put away your naked weapons! Put away your naked weapons!']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Please, Jack, calm down; the jerk’s gone. Oh you son-of-a-bitch, brave little bastard, you!']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Did he hurt you in the groin? I thought he got in a good shot at your belly.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Did you kick him out of here?']
['BARDOLPH', 'Yup! The jerk’s drunk. You hurt his shoulder.']
['FALSTAFF', 'That jerk! How dare he challenge me!']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Oh, you sweet little rogue, you! Oh my, you poor monkey, you’re sweating! Come, let me wipe your face. Come on, you fat bastard. Oh, you rogue! I swear, I love you. You’re as brave as Hector of TroyHector of Troy and Agamemnon were great heroes of the Trojan War.Hector of Troy, you’re worth five Agamemnons, and you’re ten times better than the nine wonders of the world! Oh, you villain!']
['FALSTAFF', 'The no-good jerk! I’ll wrap the rogue in a blanket, the way they punish cowards.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Do it, if you dare. If you do, I’ll toss you between a pair of sheets!']
['PAGE', 'The music is here, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll. A no-good, bragging jerk! The fool ran from me like quicksilver.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Truly, and you chased him like a church—slowly. You rotten little fat roasting pig! When will you stop fighting all day and thrusting all night, and start to get your body ready for its final resting place?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Quiet, Doll. Don’t talk like a death’s-headdeath’s-head = a skull, used as a reminder of one’s mortalitydeath’s-head. Don’t make me think of my own end.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Sirrah, what’s the PrinceDirectors must decide if Doll sees Hal and Poins and sets Falstaff up, or if she doesn’t see them and happens to ask these questions innocently.Prince like?']
['FALSTAFF', 'He’s a shallow youngster. He would have made a good pantry servant: he would have been great at trimming the crusts off bread.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'They say Poins is smart.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Him, smart? Hang him, he’s a baboon! He’s as thick as mustard, and no smarter than a sledgehammer.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Then why does the Prince love him?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Because their legs are the same size, and he likes to play the game of quoits and eat fatty foods; and he’ll play drinking games, like dropping burning candle ends into his drinks. He plays on the see-saw with the boys, and pulls crazy stunts, and curses nicely. And his boots fit nice and smooth, just like the ones painted on the shoe store’s signs. And he doesn’t cause trouble by spilling secrets. He has all kinds of qualities associated with weak minds and healthy bodies, and that’s why the Prince keeps him around: because the Prince is exactly the same. There’s not a hair’s difference between the two of them.']
['PRINCE HENRY', ' (to POINS) We should cut this fatso’s ears off.']
['POINS', 'Let’s beat him in front of his whore.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Look at that old geezerPossibly, Doll is playing with Falstaff’s hair.geezer having his head scratched like a parrot.']
['POINS', 'Isn’t it odd that desire lasts so much longer than the ability to perform?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Kiss me, Doll.']
['PRINCE HENRY', ' Saturn and VenusSaturn was the planet of old age, Venus the planet of love and desire.Saturn and Venus must be aligned this year! What do you think the astrological tables have to say about that?']
['POINS', 'And look. That fiery-faced Bardolph is whispering sweet nothings to Quickly, his master’s old confidante.']
['FALSTAFF', ' (to DOLL) You flatter me with your kisses.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'I swear, my kisses are heartfelt.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’m old. I’m old.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'I love you more than I could love any ridiculous young man in the world.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What fabric do you want a new skirt made out of? I’ll get paid on Thursday, so you’ll get a new hat tomorrow. Let’s have a happy song. It’s getting late; let’s go to bed. You’ll forget me when I’m gone.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'I swear, you’ll make me cry if you talk like that. I won’t wear any beautiful clothing till you return. Well, we’ll see what happens.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Some wine, Francis.']
['PRINCE HENRY AND POINS', 'Right away, sir!']
['FALSTAFF', 'What! A bastard son of the King? And aren’t you Poins, his brother?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Your globe, covered with continents of sin! What kind of life are you leading?']
['FALSTAFF', 'A better life than you. I’m a gentleman and you’re just a drawer.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'That’s right, sir. And I’m going to draw you out of this room by the ears.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Oh, may God bless you, sir. I swear, welcome to London. God bless that sweet face of yours! Oh Jesus! Have you come from Wales?']
['FALSTAFF', 'You son of a bitch, you insane block of royalty! (indicating DOLL) I swear on this piece of weak flesh and corrupt blood that you’re welcome here!']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'What? You fat fool! The hell with you!']
['POINS', 'My lord, if you don’t strike while the iron’s hot, he’ll turn everything into a joke and rob you of your chance for revenge.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'You son of a whore, you giant piece of candle wax, you said such horrible things about me just now, in front of this honest, upstanding and well-behaved lady.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'May God bless your good heart! She is all that, I swear.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Did you hear me?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Yes. And you knew I was there, right? It’s just like when you ran away at Gad’s HillThe incident at Gad’s Hill occurs in Act Two of Henry IV, Part One.Gad’s Hill : you knew I was the one who beat you, and you made up some story just to irritate me.']
['FALSTAFF', 'No, no, no. Not at all. I had no idea you were there.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Then I’m going to make you confess that you deliberately slandered me. And then I’ll know what to do next.']
['FALSTAFF', 'No slander, Hal. On my honor, no slander.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'No? To malign me, and call me a pantry servant and a bread-trimmer, and I don’t know what else?']
['FALSTAFF', 'No slander, Hal.']
['POINS', 'No slander?']
['FALSTAFF', 'No slander, Ned, in the world, honest Ned, none. I maligned him only to the wicked, so that the wicked wouldn’t fall in love with him. And by doing that, I’ve acted like a good friend and loyal subject, and your father should thank me for it. No slander, Hal, none, Ned. No, truly boys, none.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Now your absolute fear and utter cowardliness has made you wrong this good lady in order to make peace with us. Is she wicked? Is this hostess here wicked? Is your boy here wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose piety burns in his face? Is he wicked?']
['POINS', 'Answer, you withered old trunk, answer.']
['FALSTAFF', 'The devil has marked Bardolph as long gone, and his face is Lucifer’s kitchen, where only drunks are served. As for the boy, he may have a good spirit on one shoulder, but the devil on the other is stronger.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'And the women?']
['FALSTAFF', 'One of them is in hell already, where she gets poor souls hot. As for the other, I owe her money. If she’s damned for that, I have no idea.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'I’m not, I promise you that.']
['FALSTAFF', 'No, I think you’re not. I think you’ve been excused for that. But there’s another charge against you. You serve flesh in this place, and that’s against the law. You’re going to hell for that.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Everybody who serves food does that. What’s wrong with a bite or two of meat during Lent?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'You, good lady—']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'What is it, gracious sir?']
['FALSTAFF', 'He may speak to you graciously, but his body feels otherwise.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Who’s knocking so loudly on the door? Francis, go see.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Peto, how are you? What’s going on?']
['PETO', 'Your father the King is in Westminster. Twenty exhausted messengers have arrived from the north. And, on my way here, I met a dozen captains, hustling and working hard, knocking on the door of every tavern and searching for Sir John Falstaff.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'My God, Poins, I feel terrible wasting precious time on this idleness when a huge black storm is brewing, soon to open up on our bare, vulnerable heads. Give me my coat and my sword. Good night, Falstaff.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Now’s the sweetest part of the night, and we have to leave without enjoying it.']
['BARDOLPH', 'You have to go to the royal court immediately, sir. A dozen captains are at the door waiting for you.']
['FALSTAFF', ' (to the PAGE) Pay the musicians, Sirrah. Goodbye, waitress. Goodbye, Doll. See, wenches, how wanted we valuable men are? The good-for-nothing may sleep when the man of action is needed. Farewell, good wenches. If I’m not sent away immediately, I’ll come see you again before I go.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'I can’t speak; my heart is ready to burst. Well, sweet Jack, take care of yourself.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Farewell, farewell.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Well, goodbye. I’ve known you twenty-nine years this June. But a more honest, more good-hearted man—well, fare you well.']
['BARDOLPH', ' (offstage) Mistress Tearsheet!']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'What’s the matter?']
['BARDOLPH', ' (offstage) Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll. Come.—She’s coming, all crying and blubbering.—Will you come, Doll?']
['KING', 'Call the earls of Surrey and Warwick. Tell them to read over these letters before they come, and to think carefully about them. Hurry.']
['WARWICK', 'Good morning, your highness.']
['KING', 'Is it morning, lords?']
['WARWICK', "It’s after one o'clock."]
['KING', 'Well, then, good morning to you all, my lords. Have you read the letters I sent you?']
['WARWICK', 'We have, your highness.']
['KING', 'Then you can tell how sick the kingdom is. There are serious diseases spreading through its body, very near its heart.']
['WARWICK', 'The body’s only out of sorts. It can be brought back to full health through good care and some medicine. Northumberland will soon be suppressed.']
['KING', 'Oh God! If only we could read the book of destiny! We’d see how time changes everything, bringing mountains low and melting the land—which is tired of being solid and firm—into the sea. We’d see how the beach is sometimes too wide for even the tide to conquer. We’d see how blind luck can make mockeries of men, and how change can affect you in countless ways.']
['WARWICK', 'There is a chronicle for every man’s life, which shows what happened to him in times now past. If you study that chronicle, you can prophecy what lies ahead with some accuracy. The seeds of things to come are buried in the things that have already happened. These seeds grow, and become the children of time.']
['KING', 'Were these things necessary, then? Then we’ll treat them like necessities, even though the very word “necessities” cries out against us. They say the Archbishop and Northumberland have fifty thousand men in their army.']
['WARWICK', 'That can’t be, my lord. Rumor, like an echo, doubles the size of our enemy’s army. Please, your highness, go to bed. I swear on my soul that the army you’ve already sent out can win this battle easily. And here’s more good news: I’ve heard for sure that Glendower is dead. You’ve been ill for two weeks now, your majesty. Keeping such irregular hours will surely make things worse.']
['KING', 'I’ll listen to your advice. And once we’ve got this civil war in hand, we will, my friends, march to the Holy Land.']
['SHALLOW', 'Come on, come on, come on, sir. Shake my hand, sir, shake my hand. You’re an early riser, I swear. How are you, cousin Silence?']
['SILENCE', 'Good morning, cousin Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'And how’s my cousin, your wife? And your prettiest daughter, my fair god-daughter Ellen?']
['SILENCE', 'I’m afraid she’s got dark hairDark hair was considered unattractive.dark hair, cousin Shallow!']
['SHALLOW', 'By gum, I bet William’s become a real scholar. He’s still at Oxford, right?']
['SILENCE', 'He sure is, and I’m the one who’s paying for it.']
['SHALLOW', 'He’ll be going to law school soon. I studied law at Clement’s InnThe Inns of Court are London legal colleges.Clement’s Inn, where I think they still talk about crazy old Shallow.']
['SILENCE', 'You were known as lusty Shallow back then, cousin.']
['SHALLOW', 'I was known as anything, I swear. And I would have done anything too, and all the way, too. I was there, and little John Doit from Staffordshire, and black-haired George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, from the Cotswolds. Since then, no law college']
['SHALLOW', 'in the world has seen four swashbucklers like us. And let me tell you this: we knew where to find the highest-quality whores, and the best of them were at our beck and call. At that time, Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, was just a boy. He worked as a page for Thomas Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk.']
['SILENCE', 'Do you mean the same Sir John that’s coming here soon to recruit soldiers?']
['SHALLOW', 'The same Sir John, the very same. I saw him beat Skogan upon the head when he was a little tyke, not this high. The same day, I had a fight with a guy named Sampson Stockfish. He sold fruit behind Gray’s Inn. Jesus, Jesus! I’ve had some crazy times! To think that so many of my old pals are dead!']
['SILENCE', 'We’ll all follow them, cousin.']
['SHALLOW', 'Right you are, very right. That’s for sure, that’s for sure. Death, as the Psalms say, is certain. Everyone dies. How much are they getting for good young bulls at the Stamford county fair?']
['SILENCE', 'Truly, I wasn’t there.']
['SHALLOW', 'Death is certain. Is old Double from your hometown still alive?']
['SILENCE', 'Dead, sir.']
['SHALLOW', 'Jesus, Jesus, dead! He was a good archer, and dead! He could fire one heck of a shot. John of Gaunt loved him, and used to wager on his shooting. Dead! He could hit a target from two hundred and forty yards, and he could shoot a straight arrow two hundred and eighty yards—maybe even two hundred and ninety. That was something to see. How much are they getting for twenty ewes?']
['SILENCE', 'Depends on the quality. Twenty good ewes could be worth ten pounds.']
['SHALLOW', 'And old Double’s dead?']
['SILENCE', 'Here come two of Sir John Falstaff’s men, I think.']
['BARDOLPH', 'If you don’t mind, which of you is Judge Shallow?']
['SHALLOW', 'I’m Robert Shallow, sir, a poor landowner in this county, and one of the King’s justices of the peace. How can I help you?']
['BARDOLPH', 'My captain sends his regards. My captain, Sir John Falstaff. He’s a valiant gentleman, I swear, and a brave leader.']
['SHALLOW', 'It’s great to hear from him. I knew him to be a good fencer. How’s the good knight doing? And, if you don’t mind my asking, how’s his wife?']
['BARDOLPH', 'I beg your pardon, sir. A soldier has no need for a wife; he is well enough accommodated.']
['SHALLOW', 'Well said, I swear, sir. Well said. “Well enough accommodated!” That’s good. That’s very good. Good turns']
['BARDOLPH', 'Excuse me, sir. I’ve heard the word. You call it a turn of phrase? I don’t know anything about phrases, but I’ll fight for the word. It’s a good, soldier-like word; a word with many uses, to be sure. “Accommodated.” You can say that a man is accommodated when he has been furnished with supplies. And you can also say that a man is being accommodated when he’s, you know, being accommodatedBardolph here gives “being accommodated” a sexual connotation.being accommodated. Which is an excellent thing.']
['SHALLOW', 'It certainly is. Look, here comes good Sir John. Let me shake your hand; let me shake your hand, sir. I swear, you look good, like you haven’t aged a day. Welcome, good Sir John.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’m glad to see you’re well, Master Robert Shallow. And this is Master Surecard, isn’t it?']
['SHALLOW', 'No, Sir John. It’s my cousin Silence. Like me, he’s also a justice of the peace.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Master Silence. Your name suits a justice of “the peace.”']
['SILENCE', 'Welcome, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Damn! It’s hot out, gentlemen. Have you found half a dozen able-bodied men for me?']
['SHALLOW', 'Yes sir, we have. Won’t you sit?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Let me see them, please.']
['SHALLOW', 'Where’s the list? Where’s the list? Where’s the list? Let’s see, let’s see, let’s see. Right, right. Yes, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them come when I call. Let them do that, let them do that. Let’s see. Where’s Mouldy?']
['MOULDY', 'Here, sir.']
['SHALLOW', 'What do you think, Sir John? He’s got good muscles. Young, strong, and well-connected.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Are you Mouldy?']
['MOULDY', 'Yes, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Well then, it’s about time you were put to use.']
['SHALLOW', 'Ha, ha, ha! Excellent, I swear! Things that don’t get used enough do indeed become moldy. Good one, I swear. Well said, Sir John, very well said.']
['FALSTAFF', ' Pricki.e., mark his name on the listPrick him.']
['MOULDY', 'I’ve already been prickedpricked = annoyed; “prick” is also slang for “penis”; Mouldy puns that he has already been supplied with one.pricked well enough, thanks. You could have left me alone. My old lady’s in trouble now: she won’t have anyone to do her husbandry or her housework. You didn’t have to prick me; there are abler menhusbandry = farm work; a husband’s sexual dutiesabler men than me.']
['FALSTAFF', 'That’s enough; quiet, Mouldy. You’re going. Mouldy, it’s time you were put to use.']
['MOLDY', 'Put to use?']
['SHALLOW', 'Quiet, man, quiet. Step aside. Don’t you know where you are? Now the next, Sir John. Let’s see. Simon Shadow!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Now you’re talking. I’d like to sit under him. He’ll be a cool soldier.']
['SHALLOW', 'Where’s Shadow?']
['SHADOW', 'Here, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Shadow, whose son are you?']
['SHADOW', 'My mother’s son, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Your mother’s son? Probably, and you got your father’s name. The woman’s son is a portrait of the father; yes, that’s usually the case, though the son is little more than a dim copy, without any of the father’s true substance.']
['SHALLOW', 'Do you like him, Sir John?']
['FALSTAFF', ' Shadowshadows = fake names of nonexistent peopleShadow will be useful in the summer. Prick him, too. We’ll need him, for there are a lot of shadows filling up this roster.']
['SHALLOW', 'Thomas Wart!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Where’s he?']
['WART', 'Here, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Is your name Wart?']
['WART', 'Yup.']
['FALSTAFF', 'You’re a pretty ragged wart.']
['SHALLOW', 'Should I prick him on the list, Sir John?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Not necessary. For look: his clothing is just a bunch of pieces sewn together, and his whole body rests on legs as skinny as pins. He’s been pricked enough by pins and needles—don’t prick him anymore.']
['SHALLOW', 'Ha, ha, ha! You are funny, sir. You are funny. I’ve got to hand it to you. Francis Feeble!']
['FEEBLE', 'Here, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What kind of work do you do, Feeble?']
['FEEBLE', 'I’m a woman’s tailor, sir.']
['SHALLOW', 'Should I prick him, sir?']
['FALSTAFF', 'You might as well. But if he had been a man’s tailor, he would have already pricked you with his pins. Will you make as many holes in the enemy’s armor as you have in women’s underwear?']
['FEEBLE', 'I’ll do my best, sir. I can’t do any more.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Well said, good woman’s tailor! Well said, courageous Feeble! You’ll be as brave as the angriest dove or the most valiant mouse. Prick the woman’s tailor. A big one, Master Shallow; a deep one, Master Shallow.']
['FEEBLE', 'I wish Wart were going, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'And I wish you were a man’s tailor. You could have mended his clothes and made him fit to go. I can’t make him a private soldier when he’s already the leader of thousands—of lice, that is. But never mind, oh forcible Feeble.']
['FEEBLE', 'Never mind, sir.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I like you, good Feeble. Who’s next?']
['SHALLOW', 'Peter Bullcalf from the village green!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Oh yeah. Let’s see Bullcalf.']
['BULLCALF', 'Here, sir!']
['FALSTAFF', 'My God! What a great man! Prick Bullcalf until he shouts again.']
['BULLCALF', 'Oh Lord! My lord, good Captain—']
['FALSTAFF', 'What, you’re yelling before you’ve even been pricked?']
['BULLCALF', 'Oh Lord, sir! I’m a sick man.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What disease do you have?']
['BULLCALF', 'A nasty cold, sir. A cough, sir. I caught it when I was ringing the church bells in honor of the King’s coro-nation.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Then you’ll go to war in a dressing gown. We’ll get rid of your cold, and I’ll give orders for some of my men to ring the bells for you while you’re away. (to SHALLOW) Is this everybody?']
['SHALLOW', 'We’ve got two more here than you need. You can have four, sir. Now, come inside and eat lunch with me.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’ll have a drink with you, but I can’t stay to eat. But I’m truly glad to see you, Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'Oh, Sir John, do you remember the time we spent all night in the windmill in St. George’s field?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Don’t go there, Master Shallow. Don’t go there.']
['SHALLOW', 'Ha! That was a fun night. Is Jane Nightwork still alive?']
['FALSTAFF', 'She’s alive, Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'She never could stand me.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Never, never. She always said she couldn’t stand Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'Truly, I could anger her to the core. She was a good-looking wench then. Does she still look good?']
['FALSTAFF', 'Old, old, Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'Well, she must be old. She’s got no choice but to be old. Of course she’s old. She gave birth to Robin Nightwork, the son of old man Nightwork, before I even got to Clement’s Inn.']
['SILENCE', 'That’s fifty-five years ago.']
['SHALLOW', 'Ha, cousin Silence, if only you’d seen what this knight and I have seen! Ha! Am I right, Sir John?']
['FALSTAFF', 'We’ve seen the clock strike midnight, Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'We sure have, we sure have, we sure have. I swear, Sir John, we sure have. Our slogan was “Down the hatch, boys!” Come, let’s have lunch, let’s have lunch. Jesus, the things we’ve seen! Come, come.']
['BULLCALF', 'Good Master CorporateBullcalf’s mistake for “corporal”Corporate Bardolph, be my friend. Here are some French crowns for you, worth four Harry ten shillingsA “Harry ten shilling” was a ten-shilling coin minted during the reign of Henry VII; by Shakespeare’s time, they were each worth about five shillings.Harry ten shillings.']
['BARDOLPH', 'Whatever. Stand over there.']
['MOULDY', 'And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old lady’s sake, be my friend. She has nobody here to help her do anything once I’m gone. She’s old and can’t do much by herself. I’ll give you forty shillings, sir.']
['BARDOLPH', 'Whatever. Stand over there.']
['FEEBLE', 'I’ll tell you the truth: I don’t care one way or the other. You only die once, and we all owe God a death. I won’t do anything underhanded. If it’s my fate, it’s my fate. If not, not. No man is too good to serve his country. Whatever happens, happens. If you die this year, you’re paid up for next year.']
['BARDOLPH', 'Well said. You’re a good man.']
['FEEBLE', 'I’m telling you. I won’t do anything underhanded.']
['FALSTAFF', 'All right, sir. Which men can I have?']
['SHALLOW', 'Any four you choose.']
['BARDOLPH', 'Sir, may I have a word with you? (whispers to FALSTAFF) I’ve gotten three pounds to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.']
['FALSTAFF', 'No kidding. Great.']
['SHALLOW', 'Come on, Sir John, which four do you want?']
['FALSTAFF', 'You pick.']
['SHALLOW', 'All right, then. Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Mouldy and Bullcalf. Mouldy, you stay home till you’re too old to fight. And as for you, Bullcalf, wait till you’ve reached fighting age. I don’t want either of you.']
['SHALLOW', 'Sir John, Sir John. Don’t make a mistake. They’re the best men of the bunch, and I want you to have only the best.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Master Shallow, are you going to tell me how to choose a soldier? Do you think I care about a man’s body,']
['BARDOLPH', 'Here you go, Wart. Present arms! Right shoulder, arms! Left shoulder, arms!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Come on, handle your weapon. Yes, good. Very good. Very, very good. Oh, give me a little, skinny, old, dried-out, bald rifleman any day. Good job, Wart. You’re a good scab of a guy. Wait, here’s a testertester = sixpencetester for you.']
['SHALLOW', 'He’s no expert. He’s not doing it right. I remember up at Mile-End Park, when I was at Clement’s Inn—I played the fool in the archery pageant. There was a nimble little guy, and he would handle his weapon like this, and he would run all over the place, and he’d charge and charge. “Rat-a-tat tat,” he’d say. “Bang!” he’d say. Then he’d run away, then come back. I never saw anybody like him.']
['FALSTAFF', 'These guys will be fine, Master Shallow. God bless you, Master Silence—I won’t say much to you. Farewell, gentlemen, and thank you. I have to march twelve miles tonight. Bardolph, give the soldiers uniforms.']
['SHALLOW', 'God bless you, Sir John. May God bring you good luck, and bring us peace. When you come back, pay us']
['FALSTAFF', 'I swear, I wish you would, Master Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'I meant what I said. May God keep you.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Farewell, gentle gentlemen.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'What’s the name of this forest?']
['HASTINGS', 'Gaultree Forest, your grace.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Stop here, sirs. Send out scouts to find out how many soldiers our enemy has.']
['HASTINGS', 'We’ve already done that.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Well done. My friends and brothers in this great undertaking, I have to share with you that I’ve received new letters from Northumberland. They have a chilling purpose, tone, and content. He says that he wishes he could be here in person, with an army as strong someone of his rank should have, but he couldn’t raise one. So he’s going to go to Scotland to increase his power. He prays that your armies will prevail against the terrible power of the enemy.']
['MOWBRAY', 'And with that, any hope we had for him is thrown to the ground and dashed to pieces.']
['HASTINGS', 'What’s happening?']
['MESSENGER', 'The enemy is west of this forest, and less than a mile away. They look powerful, and, from the amount of space they’re taking up, I’d say they have close to thirty thousand soldiers.']
['MOWBRAY', 'That’s exactly the number we thought they had. Let’s march ahead and engage them in battle.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Who’s this well-equipped leader coming here to confront us?']
['MOWBRAY', 'I think it’s Lord Westmoreland.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'Our general, the Prince Lord John of Lancaster, sends greetings and wishes you good health.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Speak in peace, Lord Westmoreland. What’s the reason you’ve come here?']
['WESTMORELAND', 'The most important part of my message is for you, your grace. You, who are a holy man, and these good gentlemen as well—you would not be here, lending dignity to this bloody insurrection, if it appeared as rebellion normally does: like a lowborn mob, led by bloody youths uniformed in rags, and supported by boys and beggars.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Why am I doing this? That is the question. The short answer is this: we’re all sick. We’ve eaten and drunk too much and stayed up all night, and now we have a burning fever whose only cure is bloodletting. Richard, our late King, was infected with this disease and died from it. But, my good Lord Westmoreland, I’m not here as a physician, nor am I marching with this army as an enemy of peace. What I’m doing is making a frightening show of war, to stop people from indulging all their vices. This will clear the hardening of the arteries which threatens to kill us all. Let me speak more plainly. I’ve carefully considered the options, weighing the harm our armies are likely to cause against the harm we’re already suffering, and I find that our grievances are stronger than our offenses. We can see where things are headed, and the rough times ahead leave us with no choice but to step away from our quiet lives. We have a list of grievances which we can publish at the appropriate time. We offered that list to the King a long time ago, but we could never get an audience with him.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'When was your request to see the King denied? How has the king harmed you? What lord in the King’s court has been sent out to do you wrong? And why would you put your holy stamp of approval on an illegal uprising and give religious blessing to a violent civil war?']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'The grievancesThe original text of this difficult passage may be corrupted; its exact meaning is obscure.grievances borne by my fellow Englishmen, and the cruel murder of Scroop, my own brother: these are the reasons I’ve made this fight my own.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'There’s no need for any repayment like that; and even if there were, you should not be the person to benefit.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Why shouldn’t he benefit at least a little? Why shouldn’t we all benefit, who suffered in these recent battles, and who have allowed our honor to be damaged by the terrible things happening now?']
['WESTMORELAND', 'Oh, my good Lord Mowbray, if you think about what is necessary in times of war, you’ll see that it is the situation']
['MOWBRAY', "What did my father lose that I now need to restore? Richard, the King at the time, loved my father, but given what was happening he had no choice but to banish him. And then, at Coventry, my father and Harry Bolingbroke met in a formal challengeThe duel between Bolingbroke (now King Henry) and Norfolk (Mowbray’s father) occurs in Richard II, 1.3.challenge. They were both mounted on their horses and ready to charge. Their horses were neighing, anxiously waiting for their riders' spurs to drive them forward. Their steel-tipped lances were ready for the attack. The visors of their helmets were down. Their eyes were on fire behind the steel slits. The trumpet sounded, and then—when there was nothing that could have stopped my father from killing Bolingbroke—the King prevented the fight by throwing down his royal scepter. That scepter was a symbol of his life; when he threw it down, he threw down his life and the lives of every man that has since died at war under the leadership of Bolingbroke."]
['WESTMORELAND', 'You don’t know what you’re talking about, Lord Mowbray. Bolingbroke at the time was considered the bravest gentleman in England. Who knows who would have won that fight? But even if your father had won, he never would have made it out of Coventry. The whole country hated him, and they loved and prayed for Bolingbroke.']
['MOWBRAY', 'But he’s made us force him to listen to us. His offer isn’t motivated by love; it’s a political move.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'Mowbray, you’re out of line to think that. His offer is made out of mercy, not fear. Just look, you can see our army from here. I give you my word of honor: that army is so confident, it won’t even allow the thought of fear to enter. Our army has more important people than yours, and better soldiers; our armor is every bit as strong as yours, and our cause is better. It’s only logical that we should be as courageous as you are. So don’t say you’ve forced the Prince to do anything at all.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Well, I say we won’t agree to any conference.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'That just proves that what you’re doing here is shameful. A rotten container falls apart at the touch; likewise, a rotten cause cannot withstand scrutiny and argument.']
['HASTINGS', 'Has the King given Prince John his full authorization to listen to our complaint, and address it in any way the Prince sees fit?']
['WESTMORELAND', 'That goes without saying. I’m amazed you’d even ask such a foolish question.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Then, Lord Westmoreland, take this document. It lists our grievances. If each complaint listed here is addressed, and if everyone on our side, both here and elsewhere, is granted a full pardon and immediate satisfaction of our demands, then we’ll return to our own boundaries again and work together for the cause of peace.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'I’ll show this to the general. Please, let’s meet at a place where both our armies can see us. Then either let our talks end in peace—God willing!—or let us take the fight to the battlefield where it will be decided.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'My lord, we will do so.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Something in my heart tells me that no peace we agree to could possibly last.']
['HASTINGS', 'Don’t worry about that. If we can come to terms that are as comprehensive as the ones we’re insisting upon, then the peace will be as durable as rocky mountains.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Yes, but in the future the King will think so poorly of us that every little slight, every false accusation, every tiny, silly, frivolous thing will seem to him to be a revival of this rebellion. Even if we were as devoted to the King as martyrs are to their causes, he’ll regard us so skeptically that even the good things we do for him']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'No, no, sir. Listen, the king is tired of getting upset over every little thing. He’s discovered that ending one problem by killing someone only creates two bigger problems in the people left alive. So from now on, he’ll wipe his memory clean, and forget anything that might remind him of the bad things from his past. He knows that he can’t just eliminate every single opponent who crops up.']
['HASTINGS', 'Besides, the King has expended all his energy for punishment on the recent rebellion. He has nothing left to punish with. His power is like a lion with no teeth: it can threaten, but it can’t do any harm.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'That’s true. Rest assured, my good Lord Marshal, if our reconciliation is sincere, then peace will be like a broken bone, which grows stronger for having once been broken.']
['MOWBRAY', 'I hope so. Lord Westmoreland is back.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'The Prince is nearby. If you will, please meet him at a spot halfway between our two armies.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Your grace, Archbishop of York, go forward in God’s name.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Lead on, and greet his highness. (to WESTMORELAND) Sir, we’re on our way.']
['LANCASTER', 'I’m glad to see you, my cousin Mowbray. Good day to you, gentle Archbishop, and to you, Lord Hastings, and to all. Lord Archbishop, it was better to see you when worshippers—called together by the church bell—surrounded you to hear Biblical sermons than it is to see you here, in armor; cheering a mob of rebels with your war drums, turning your words to weapons, and your life into death.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Good Lord of Lancaster, I am not here as an enemy your father’s peace. But, as I told Westmoreland, these tumultuous times have forced us to behave in these monstrous ways, out of common sense and a regard for our own safety. I sent you a detailed list of our grievances, but you angrily shoved it aside. That’s why this Hydra of a warThe Hydra was a monster with many heads; each time a head was cut off, a new one would grow in its place.Hydra of a war has broken out. You can get rid of it by agreeing to the just and right things we demand. If you do that, this disease of war will be cured, and the monster will bow at your feet, tame and obedient.']
['MOWBRAY', 'If you don’t, we’re ready to fight to the last man.']
['HASTINGS', 'And if those of us who are here should fail, we have reinforcements  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding by. If they fail, they have reinforcements to back them up,']
['LANCASTER', 'You’re not wise enough, Hastings, not wise enough at all to see into eternity.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'Your highness, why not tell them directly what you think of their list of grievances.']
['LANCASTER', 'I agree with all of them, and I admit that they’re legitimate. I swear, on my family’s honor: my father’s intentions have been misunderstood, and some of his subordinates have overstepped their authority in executing his orders.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'I’ll take your word as a prince that you’ll make good on these things.']
['LANCASTER', 'I give you my word, and I’ll keep it. And with that, I drink a toast to you.']
['HASTINGS', 'Go, captain. Tell the army this news of peace. Pay them, and send them away. I know it will make them happy. Hurry, captain.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Here’s to you, good Lord Westmoreland.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'I drink to your grace. If you knew how hard I’ve worked to bring about this peaceful resolution, you’d really drink up. But my love for you will be more apparent from now on.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'I don’t doubt it.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'I’m glad. And here’s to your health, my gentle cousin Lord Mowbray.']
['MOWBRAY', 'You wish me good health at a very good moment, because for some reason I’m suddenly feeling ill.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Men are always merry in the face of bad situations, but a heavy heart predicts a happy event.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'So be happy, kinsman. A sudden feeling of melancholy is just a sign that says, “Something good is coming tomorrow.”']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Believe me, I’m in really good spirits.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Which is not a good thing, if your own rule is correct.']
['LANCASTER', 'The news of peace has been announced. Listen to them shout!']
['MOWBRAY', 'They sound like they are cheering a victory.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Peace is a victory of sorts: both sides stop fighting honorably, but neither loses.']
['LANCASTER', 'Go and disperse our army, too, Lord Westmoreland.']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Go, Lord Hastings, and have them march past before they’re dismissed.']
['LANCASTER', 'I hope, sirs, that we’ll spend tonight in the same camp.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'The leaders have orders from you to stand fast, and they won’t disperse until they hear you give the order.']
['LANCASTER', 'They know how to follow orders.']
['HASTINGS', 'Our army is already dispersed. They’ve headed off to the east, west, north, and south like young bulls whose yokes have been removed. The men are like children after school, each hurrying toward their homes or the playground.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'That’s good news, Lord Hastings. And hearing it, I now arrest you, traitor, for high treason. And you, Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray. I arrest you both for capital treason.']
['MOWBRAY', 'Is this action just and honorable?']
['WESTMORELAND', 'Was your rebellion just and honorable?']
['ARCHBISHOP', 'Will you break faith with us like this?']
['LANCASTER', 'I never promised you my faith. I promised to make good on the grievances you complained of. And, on my honor, I will do that as carefully as possible. But now, you rebels will get exactly what you deserve for the things you’ve done. You raised armies over nothing, brought them here stupidly, and then foolishly sent them away. Bang on our drums! Capture the soldiers who are scattering away. God, not we, has fought today and won. Guards, escort these traitors to the place of their death. That’s where treason belongs, and where they’ll draw their last breath.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What’s your name, sir? What’s your rank, and where are you from?']
['COLEVILLE', 'I am a knight, sir. My name is Coleville of the Valley.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Well, then, Coleville is your name, your rank is knight, and the valley is where you’re from. Coleville will still be your name now that “traitor” is your rank, and the dungeon is where you’ll be. It’s a place so deep that you’ll still be in a kind of valley.']
['COLEVILLE', 'Aren’t you Sir John Falstaff?']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’m as good a man as Falstaff, whoever I am. Will you surrender? Or am I going to have to break a sweat making you surrender? If I sweat, the drops will be the tears of your loved ones, weeping over your death. So you’d better get scared and start to shake, and start praying to me for mercy.']
['COLEVILLE', 'I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and so I surrender.']
['FALSTAFF', 'My enormous belly can speak in many languages, and each language proclaims my name and my name alone. If I had a moderately sized belly, all I’d be is an anonymous but very successful soldier. But my belly, my belly, my belly blows my cover. Here comes the general.']
['LANCASTER', 'The danger’s over: let’s stop here.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’m sorry to hear you say that: I never realized that brave behavior should be rewarded with scolding and admonishing. Do you think I’m a bird, or an arrow, or a bullet? With this old, broken-down body, do you think I can move as fast as thought? I’ve gotten here as fast as humanly possible. I’ve burned out more than 180 horses, and—even though I’m spent from all that travel—I’ve managed, with my extraordinary bravery, to capture Sir John Coleville of the Valley, a brave knight and terrible enemy. But so what? He simply saw me and surrendered. So I can say, just like Julius Caesar, that “I came, I saw, I conquered.”']
['LANCASTER', 'He was just being polite; it’s not as if you did something to deserve it.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I don’t know about that. Here he is: I turn him over to you. Please, sir, have it added to the record of things accomplished today. If you don’t, I’ll have a ballad printed about it, with a picture of Coleville kissing my foot on the cover. And if I’m forced to do that, and I']
['LANCASTER', 'Your pile would be too heavy for me to bear.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Let my merits shine, then.']
['LANCASTER', 'You’re too dense to shine.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Then let it do something that will do me good, whatever you want to call it.']
['LANCASTER', 'Is your name Coleville?']
['COLEVILLE', 'It is, sir.']
['LANCASTER', 'You’re a famous rebel, Coleville.']
['FALSTAFF', 'And a famous and loyal subject captured him.']
['COLEVILLE', 'I’m now in the same situation as my superiors, who led me here. But if I had been in charge, your victory would have cost you more than it has.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I don’t know how much your superiors cost us, but you, like a generous man, gave yourself away for free, and I thank you for it.']
['LANCASTER', 'Have you called off the troops?']
['WESTMORELAND', 'The order to pull back has been given, and the slaughter has been stopped.']
['LANCASTER', 'Send Coleville and his confederates to York, to be put to death immediately. Blunt, lead him away, and guard him carefully.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Sir, please give me permission to go via Gloucestershire. When you get to the court, please vouch for my good work here.']
['LANCASTER', 'Goodbye, Falstaff. By speaking on your behalf as a prince, I’ll be speaking better of you than you deserve.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I wish you had the wit to accomplish that: it would be worth all your land. My goodness, this young, serious-minded boy doesn’t like me, and no one can make him laugh. But I guess that’s not surprising; after all, he doesn’t drink any wine. None of those prim boys ever amount to anything: weak beer and too many fish dinners makes their blood cool. They all turn anemic, like young girls. And then, when they finally get married, they can only father girls because they don’t have the stuff to produce sons. Non-drinkers are all generally fools and cowards. The rest of us would probably be']
['BARDOLPH', 'The army is dismissed, and everyone’s gone.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Let them go. I’ll head to Gloucestershire. I’ll visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I’ve already got him under my thumb, as soft as wax. Soon I’ll seal the deal. Let’s go.']
['KING', 'Now, my lords: if God grants us a victory in this violent civil war that bleeds at our very doorsteps, I will lead our young people in a greater cause, and fight nothing but holy wars. Our navy is ready, our army is assembled, the leaders who are my subordinates have their orders, and everything is standing by to achieve my main aim. The only drawback is that I’m feeling a little weak. So let’s wait a short while, until the rebels, now on the run, are brought back in line and are made obedient again.']
['WARWICK', "We are sure that you’ll soon enjoy both good health and the rebels' defeat."]
['KING', 'My son Humphrey of Gloucester, where is your brother, Prince Hal?']
['GLOUCESTER', 'I think he’s gone hunting at Windsor.']
['KING', 'Who’s with him?']
['GLOUCESTER', 'I don’t know, father.']
['KING', 'Isn’t his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?']
['GLOUCESTER', 'No, father. He’s here.']
['CLARENCE', 'What is it you’d like, father?']
['KING', 'Only good things for you, Thomas. Why aren’t you with the Prince, your brother? He loves you and you are neglecting him. He cares more about you than any of his other brothers, Thomas; cherish that fact, my boy. After I’m dead, you’ll be in a strong position to help maintain good relations between Prince Hal and his brothers.']
['CLARENCE', 'I’ll watch over him with as much care and love as possible.']
['KING', 'Then why aren’t you with him at Windsor?']
['CLARENCE', 'He’s not there today. He’s in London.']
['KING', 'Who’s with him? Do you know?']
['CLARENCE', 'Poins, and the usual suspects.']
['KING', 'Weeds grow best in the richest soil, and he—like myself at that age—is overrun by them. My sadness, then, cannot end with my death. When I imagine the lawless days and rotten times that you will face when I am dead and sleeping with my ancestors, the blood weeps from my heart.']
['WARWICK', 'Your highness, you’ve got him all wrong. The Prince is only studying his criminal companions, the way one studies a foreign language. In order to truly learn a language, one must learn even the most immodest curse word—which, as you know, is only learned in order to be identified and, thereafter, avoided. So, like vulgar language, the Prince will get rid of his followers when the time is right. Then they’ll live on in his memory as guidelines, by which he’ll judge the conduct of others. In this sense, he’ll change his past bad deeds to good ends.']
['KING', 'It’s rare that a bee builds its nest in a dead animal’s carcass. The Prince won’t leave his current company.']
['WESTMORELAND', 'I wish your highness good health, and happy news beyond the report I have to deliver! Prince John sends his respects: Mowbray, the Archbishop, Hastings and the rest are under arrest. There are no more rebels anywhere; the olive branch of peace has been extended everywhere.']
['KING', 'Oh Westmoreland; you’re like a summer bird, which sings the dawn in as winter ends.']
['HARCOURT', 'May heaven protect your highness from all enemies—and when they do rise up, may they fall just like the ones I’ve come to tell you about. The Earl of Northumberland and Lord Bardolph, with their mighty armies of Englishmen and Scotsmen, were defeated by the Sheriff of Yorkshire. This letter will tell you the details.']
['KING', 'Why am I sick at this good news? Why can’t life ever bring you things with their appropriate complements? Why is good news so often conveyed in ugly terms? Life either gives you hunger but no food—which is the']
['GLOUCESTER', 'Take care, your highness!']
['CLARENCE', 'Oh, my royal father!']
['WESTMORELAND', 'My lord, feel better; take courage.']
['WARWICK', 'Wait a minute, princes. You know his highness has these episodes all the time. Move away from him. Give him air; he’ll be all right soon.']
['CLARENCE', 'No, no, he can’t survive these attacks much longer. His mind’s endless worry and concern have so shaken his body that it can barely hold together.']
['GLOUCESTER', 'The people are frightening me. They’ve seen terrible omens: children who seem to have supernatural fathers, and gruesomely deformed infants. The weather is in disarray, as if the calendar discovered some months were fast asleep, and decided to skip over them.']
['CLARENCE', 'The river has flooded three times, without receding between floods. The old people—those living history books—say that the last time this happened was when our great-grandfather, King Edward, fell ill and died.']
['WARWICK', 'Speak more softly, princes: the King is recovering.']
['GLOUCESTER', 'These attacks will be the death of him.']
['KING', 'Please, carry me into another room. Quietly. Please.']
['WARWICK', 'Call the musicians in from the other room.']
['KING', 'Put the crown here on my pillow.']
['CLARENCE', 'His eyes are sunken, and he seems very pale.']
['WARWICK', 'Less noise, less noise!']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Has anybody seen the Duke of Clarence?']
['CLARENCE', 'I’m here, brother, full of sadness.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'What’s going on? Raining inside while it’s dry outside? How’s the King?']
['GLOUCESTER', 'Extremely sick.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Has he heard the good news yet? Tell him.']
['GLOUCESTER', 'Yes, he heard it, and it affected him deeply.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'If he’s sick from joy, then he’ll get better without medicine.']
['WARWICK', 'Not so loud, sirs. Prince, speak more quietly. Your father the King is trying to sleep.']
['CLARENCE', 'Let’s go into the other room.']
['WARWICK', 'Will you come with us?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'No. I’ll stay here with the King.']
['KING', ' (waking) Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!']
['CLARENCE', 'Did you call, sir?']
['WARWICK', 'What can we do for you, your highness? How are you feeling?']
['KING', 'Why did you leave me alone, sirs?']
['CLARENCE', 'We left my brother, Prince Hal, here. He decided to sit with you.']
['KING', 'The Prince of Wales? Where is he? I want to see him. He’s not here.']
['WARWICK', 'This door’s open. He went this way.']
['GLOUCESTER', 'He didn’t come through the room we were in.']
['KING', 'Where’s the crown? Who took it off my pillow?']
['WARWICK', 'When we left, sir, it was here.']
['KING', 'The Prince has taken it. Go, find him. Is he in such a hurry that he thinks my sleep is my death? Find him, Lord Warwick. Rebuke him, and bring him here.']
['WARWICK', 'Sir, I found the Prince in the next room, with tears flowing down his cheeks. He looked so sorrowful that a tyrant—who never drank anything but blood—would, upon seeing him, have washed the blood from his knife with tears. He’s on his way.']
['KING', 'But why did he take away the crown?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'I never thought I’d hear you speak again.']
['KING', 'You thought that because you wished it to be true. I live too long for you; you’re tired of me. Are you so desperate for my throne that you would take the honors of kingship before it’s your time? Oh you foolish youth! You long for power that will end up overwhelming you. Wait a little while. What power I have left is held together so weakly that the lightest breeze would blow it away: my life is fading.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Oh forgive me, your highness. If it weren’t for these tears—which are impeding my speech—I would have stopped this harsh scolding before you, in your grief, had spoken and before I had listened so long. There’s your crown. May God, who wears the crown eternally, guard it as yours for a long time. If I care for the crown in any way other than as a symbol of your honor and reputation, let me never rise from this kneeling position. It is my deepest and most dutiful feelings which teach my body to bend and bow to you, causing my outer body to reflect my inner feelings. May God be my witness: when I came in here and saw that you weren’t breathing, my blood ran cold. If I’m lying,']
['KING', 'Oh my son, God made you take it from me so that, in pleading your case so beautifully, you would make me love you more! Come here, Harry. Sit by my bed and listen to what I think will be the last advice I ever give. God knows the unusual paths and indirect, crooked ways that led me to this crown.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'My gracious lord, you won it, wore it, kept it, then gave it to me. My possession of it must therefore be honest']
['KING', 'Look, look, here comes my son, John of Lancaster.']
['LANCASTER', 'Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!']
['KING', 'You bring me happiness and peace, John. But health, unfortunately, has flown from this shrunken body. Now that I’ve seen you, I have nothing more to do in this world. Where is Lord Warwick?']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'Lord Warwick!']
['KING', 'Does the room I first collapsed in have a name?']
['WARWICK', 'It’s called the Jerusalem Room, your highness.']
['KING', 'Praise be to God! That’s where I must die. For years it’s been predicted that I would die in Jerusalem; I foolishly thought that meant the Holy Land. But carry me to that room, and there I’ll lie. In that Jerusalem will Harry die.']
['SHALLOW', 'By gum, sir, you will not leave tonight. Hey, Davy!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Please excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', 'I will not excuse you. You will not be excused. Excuses will not be allowed. No excuse will do. You will not be excused. Hey, Davy!']
['DAVY', 'Here, sir.']
['SHALLOW', 'Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let’s see, Davy, let’s see, Davy, let’s see. Oh yes, right: tell William the cook to come here. Sir John, you will not be excused.']
['DAVY', 'Well sir, here’s the thing. Those warrants couldn’t be served. And once more, sir, should we plant wheat at the field’s edges?']
['SHALLOW', 'Plant red wheat, Davy. But as for William the cook—aren’t there any young pigeons?']
['DAVY', 'Yes, sir. Here’s the bill from the blacksmith for horseshoes and plow blades.']
['SHALLOW', 'Check the figures and then and pay it. Sir John, you will not be excused.']
['DAVY', 'Now, sir, we need some new chain for the bucket. And sir, do you plan to dock William’s pay for the wine he lost at the Hinckley fair?']
['SHALLOW', 'He’ll pay for that. Some pigeons, Davy; a couple of short-legged hens, a leg of lamb, and any fun little fancy dishes. Tell William the cook.']
['DAVY', 'Is the soldier staying all night?']
['SHALLOW', 'Yes, Davy. I’ll take good care of him. A friend at court is better than money in your pocket. Take good care of his men, Davy. They’re good-for-nothings, and they’ll bite you.']
['DAVY', 'No worse than they’re bitten, sir. Their clothes are full of lice.']
['SHALLOW', 'Good one, Davy. Get on with your work, Davy.']
['DAVY', 'Please, sir, rule in favor of William Visor of Woncot in his lawsuit against Clement Perkes of the hill.']
['SHALLOW', 'Davy, there are a lot of suits against that Visor. That Visor is a good-for-nothing, as best I can tell.']
['DAVY', 'I agree with your honor that he’s a good-for-nothing, but God forbid that a good-for-nothing should be denied a favor when his friend asks for one on his behalf. An honest man can speak for himself, but a good-for-nothing can’t. I’ve worked for you for eight years, sir. If I can’t get you to rule in favor of a good-']
['SHALLOW', 'Stop now; I tell you he won’t be wronged. Now get going, Davy.']
['BARDOLPH', 'I’m glad to see you, your honor.']
['SHALLOW', 'I thank you with all my heart, Master Bardolph. (to the PAGE) Welcome, you tall fellow. Come, Sir John.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’ll be right behind you, Master Robert Shallow.']
['SHALLOW', ' (offstage) Sir John!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Coming, Master Shallow! Coming!']
['WARWICK', 'What’s happening, my Lord Chief Justice? Where are you going?']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'How’s the King doing?']
['WARWICK', 'Very well. All his worries are ended now.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Not dead, I hope.']
['WARWICK', 'He’s gone down nature’s path; for our purposes, he is no longer living.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I wish his majesty had brought me with him. The work I did for him while he was alive makes me very vulnerable, now that he’s dead.']
['WARWICK', 'Indeed, I think the young King has no love for you.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I know he doesn’t. I’m preparing myself to deal with whatever happens, which can’t be any worse than what I’ve imagined.']
['WARWICK', 'Here come the heavy-hearted children of dead Harry. If only the living Harry had the character of the worst of these three young men. Then a lot of noblemen would remain secure, instead of having to step aside to make room for lowlifes.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Oh God! I’m afraid everything will be turned upside-down.']
['LANCASTER', 'Good morning, cousin Warwick, good morning.']
['GLOUCESTER AND CLARENCE', 'Good morning, cousin.']
['LANCASTER', 'We’re all like men who don’t remember how to speak.']
['WARWICK', 'We remember how, but what we have to say is so sad that we cannot speak.']
['LANCASTER', 'Well, peace be with the man who has made us sad.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Peace be with us, or else we’ll be even sadder!']
['GLOUCESTER', 'Oh, my good lord, you’ve lost a friend, indeed. I’m sure you’re not borrowing that sorrowful face; it’s certainly your own.']
['LANCASTER', 'Even though no man can know what blessings will come his way, he must expect the worst. I am sorry; I wish it were otherwise.']
['CLARENCE', 'Well, now you are only allowed to speak well of Sir John Falstaff, which goes against the nature of a man of your quality.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Sweet princes, what I did, I did honorably, impartially, and with a clear conscience. You won’t see me begging vilely for a pardon, which is sure to be withdrawn as soon as it is given. If truth and honest innocence don’t help me, then I’ll join my dead King and tell him who sent me.']
['WARWICK', 'Here comes the Prince.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Good morning, and God save your majesty!']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'This new and gorgeous robe of majesty doesn’t fit me as comfortably as you think. Brothers, your sadness is mixed with fear. This is the English court, not the Turkish one. I’m not Amurath, who had his brothers killed when he inherited his father King Amurath’s crown; I’m a Harry, following another Harry. But be sad, brothers, because truly, it suits you. You look so regal in your sorrow that I will solemnly put it on as well, and wear it in my heart. Be sad, but don’t let it be anything more than a burden we all share jointly. I want you to rest assured that as far as I’m concerned, I’ll be both your father and your brother now. Just trust me with your love, and you can trust me to care for you. Keep weeping for Harry, who is dead; I will, as well. But one Harry still lives, and he will convert those tears one by one into hours of happiness.']
['PRINCES', 'We hope that’s exactly what you’ll do.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'You’re all looking at me strangely. (to the CHIEF JUSTICE) You, most of all. I think you’re certain that I don’t love you.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I’m certain that, if my actions are fairly considered, your majesty will find no just reason to hate me.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'No? How can a great prince like me forget the terrible wrongs you did me? What were you thinking, to scold, punish, and violently imprison the heir to the English throne? Was this nothing? Should this be dipped in the river of forgetfulness and simply ignored?']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I acted with the authority of your father, whose power was vested in me. And when it came to the law—which I was busy enforcing, for the good of the country—you chose to ignore my rank, and the majesty and power of law and justice which I bore as a representative of the King. You struck me in the head, the very location of my judgment. With that action, you committed a crime against your father’s own laws. So I did what my power demanded, and imprisoned you. If that was wrong, then—now that you wear the crown—I hope you’ll someday be satisfied with a son who mocks your laws, who scorns the judges who rule in your authority, who disrupts the course of law, and blunts the swords that guard your personal peace and safety.']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'You’re right, Chief Justice, and you have considered this well. Therefore, keep your position as judge and enforcer. I hope that your honors increase, and that you live to see a son of mine offend and then obey you, as I have. I will live to speak my father’s words: “I am a happy man, to have a man brave enough to punish my own son; and I’m no less happy to have a son that would surrender his greatness, and put himself in the hands of the law.”']
['SHALLOW', 'No, you’re going to see my orchard. We’ll sit in an arbor and eat some of the pippin apples I cross-bred last season, along with some caraway seeds and so on. Come on, Silence. Then we’ll go to bed.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I swear, you have a good-looking place here, and it’s fancy.']
['SHALLOW', 'Cheap, cheap, cheap. We’re broke, broke, Sir John. But one thing we do have is good air. Set the table, Davy, set the table. Good job, Davy.']
['FALSTAFF', 'This Davy does a lot for you. He’s your right-hand man as well as your steward.']
['SHALLOW', 'A good servant, a very good servant, Sir John. By God, I had too much wine with dinner. A good servant. Now sit down, sit down. Come on, cousin.']
['SILENCE', 'Ah, Sirrah, he said. We will:']
['FALSTAFF', 'That’s a merry heart! Master Silence, I’ll drink a toast to you in a minute.']
['SHALLOW', 'Davy, get Master Bardolph some wine.']
['DAVY', 'Sit, kind sir; I’ll be with you in a second. Very kind sir, please sit. Here’s to you! What we lack in food, we make up for in drink. You must endure it; good intentions are what count.']
['SHALLOW', 'Enjoy yourself, Master Bardolph, and you, my little soldier, enjoy yourself.']
['SILENCE', ' (sings) Enjoy, enjoy! My wife has it all,']
['FALSTAFF', 'I didn’t think Master Silence had this in him.']
['SILENCE', 'Who, me? I’ve let loose once or twice in my life.']
['DAVY', '(to BARDOLPH) Here’s a dish of red apples for you.']
['SHALLOW', 'Davy!']
['DAVY', 'Yes, sir! I’ll be with you in a second. (to BARDOLPH) A cup of wine, sir?']
['SILENCE', ' (sings) A cup of wine that’s fresh and fine,']
['FALSTAFF', 'Well said, Master Silence.']
['SILENCE', 'And we will enjoy ourselves. Now’s the best time of night.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Here’s to your health and long life, Master Silence.']
['SILENCE', ' (sings) Fill the cup, and pass it here,']
['SHALLOW', 'Welcome, honest Master Bardolph. If you want something and don’t ask for it, that’s your tough luck. (to the PAGE) Welcome, my little tiny thief, welcome indeed. I’ll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the good sports around London.']
['DAVY', 'I hope to see London once before I die.']
['BARDOLPH', 'If I see you there, Davy—']
['SHALLOW', 'By God, you’ll break open a quart bottle together, ha! Won’t you, Master Bardolph?']
['BARDOLPH', 'Yessir, in a two-quart glass.']
['SHALLOW', 'By God’s fingers, I thank you. This rogue will stick with you, I promise you that. He won’t fail, he’s true blue.']
['BARDOLPH', 'And I’ll stick with him, sir.']
['SHALLOW', 'Spoken like a king. Take whatever you want: enjoy yourselves!']
['FALSTAFF', ' (to SILENCE) You’re really keeping up with me!']
['SILENCE', ' (sings) Keep up with me,']
['FALSTAFF', 'Right.']
['SILENCE', 'Right? Then you’ve got to admit that an old man can do some things.']
['DAVY', 'Sir, if I may say so, there’s someone named Pistol here from the royal court. He’s got news.']
['FALSTAFF', 'From the royal court? Let him in.']
['PISTOL', 'God save you, Sir John.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What wind blew you here, Pistol?']
['PISTOL', 'Not the evil wind that blows no one toward any good. Sweet knight, you are now one of the hugest men in the country.']
['SILENCE', 'I swear, I think he is—except for the good fellow Puff, from Barson.']
['PISTOL', 'Puff? Puff in your face, you degenerate coward! Sir John, I’m your Pistol and your friend, and I rode at full tilt to find you here. I bring you reports, and good luck, and golden times, and happy, valuable news.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Then please, deliver this news like a human being who lives in this world.']
['PISTOL', 'Damn this world, and the vile little people who live in it! I’m talking about Africa, and its golden joys.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Oh, you vulgar Assyrian knight, what is your news? Convey to King CophetuaFalstaff is aping Pistol’s high-flown style. Cophetua was an African king who married a beggar.King Cophetua the story therein.']
['SILENCE', ' (sings) And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and Johna lyric from a popular songAnd Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.']
['PISTOL', 'Will junkyard dogs attack the Muses, goddesses of poetry? Will my good news be thwarted this way? Then Pistol, go ahead and plead with the Furies, the goddesses of revenge.']
['SILENCE', 'Honest gentleman, I don’t know what kind of family you’re from.']
['PISTOL', 'That’s your loss.']
['SHALLOW', 'Forgive me saying so, sir, but if you’ve got news from the court, then you have only two choices: you can either tell it or not tell it. I have some authority from the King, you know.']
['PISTOL', 'From which king, you beggar? Speak, or die.']
['SHALLOW', 'For King Henry.']
['PISTOL', 'Henry the Fourth, or Fifth?']
['SHALLOW', 'Henry the Fourth.']
['PISTOL', 'Then screw your position! Sir John, your tender little lamb is now the king. Henry the Fifth’s the man, and I speak the truth. When Pistol tells a lie, do this (he makes an obscene gesture) and tell me to go screw myself, like some crazy Spaniard.']
['FALSTAFF', 'What? Is the old King dead?']
['PISTOL', 'As a doornail: these things I say are true.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Get going, Bardolph! Saddle up my horse. Master Robert Shallow, pick whatever job you want in the whole country: it’s yours. Pistol, I’ll pile honors on you.']
['BARDOLPH', 'Oh happy day! I wouldn’t even trade a knighthood for my new, good fortune.']
['PISTOL', 'There you go! I brought good news!']
['FALSTAFF', 'Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow—Lord Shallow—call yourself whatever you want. I’m in']
['PISTOL', 'May vultures eat out his lungs, too! You know the old saying, “What happened to the life I used to lead?” Well, they’re here; welcome to these pleasant days.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'No, you horrible rogue! I wish to God I were dead, so I could have you hanged. You dislocated my shoulder!']
['FIRST BEADLE', 'The street cops handed her over to me, and she’ll be whipped through and through, I promise. She’s been involved in a couple of murders.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Pig, Pig! You lie! Come on! I’ll tell you what, you damned flabby-faced moron: if I have a miscarriage now, you’ll wish you’d hit your own mother, you pasty-faced villain!']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Oh God, I wish Sir John would come! He’d make somebody bleed for this. I pray to God that she has a miscarriage!']
['FIRST BEADLE', 'Well, if she does, you’ll have twelve cushions on your couch again. You have only eleven now, since she’s wearing one of them under her dress. I order both of you to come with me: the man that you two and Pistol beat up is dead.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'I’ll tell you what, you stick-figure; I’ll have you beaten soundly for this. You blue-coated rogue, you filthy, starving correctioner! If you aren’t walloped for this, I’ll swear off skirts.']
['FIRST BEADLE', 'Come on, come on, you little night sinner, come on.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Oh God! I can’t believe that right is overcoming might! Well, challenges build character.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Come on, you bastard, come on. Bring me to a judge.']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'Yeah, come on, you starved dog.']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Master Death! Master Bones!']
['MISTRESS QUICKLY', 'You skeleton, you!']
['DOLL TEARSHEET', 'Come on, you thin thing; come on, you lean deer!']
['FIRST BEADLE', 'Very well.']
['FIRST GROOM', 'More rushes; more rushes.']
['SECOND GROOM', 'The trumpets have blown twice.']
['FIRST GROOM', "It’ll be two o'clock before they arrive from the coronation. Hurry, hurry."]
['FALSTAFF', 'Stand here near me, Master Robert Shallow. I’ll make the King do good things for you: I’ll throw him a look as he passes by. Just watch the face he’ll make at me.']
['PISTOL', 'God bless your lungs, good knight.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Come here, Pistol. Stand behind me. (to SHALLOW) Oh, if I’d had time to make new clothes I would have spent the thousand pounds I borrowed from you. But it doesn’t matter. These poor clothes are better; it shows how desperate I was to see him.']
['SHALLOW', 'It does indeed.']
['FALSTAFF', 'It shows how sincerely I love him—']
['SHALLOW', 'It does indeed.']
['FALSTAFF', 'My devotion—']
['SHALLOW', 'It does, it does, it does.']
['FALSTAFF', 'In a word, to ride all night; not to stop and think, not to dawdle, not to take the time to change my clothes—']
['SHALLOW', 'It is best, no doubt about it.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Standing here filthy from traveling, and sweating with my desire to see him; thinking of nothing else, disregarding everything, as if the only thing in the world that mattered was seeing him.']
['PISTOL', 'That’s how it is. Nothing else matters. Semper idem. Obsque hoc nihil estThese Latin phrases translate as “Ever the same” and “Apart from this, there is nothing.”Semper idem. Obsque hoc nihil est.']
['SHALLOW', 'That’s exactly right.']
['PISTOL', 'Knight, I’ll fire up your noble liver and make you enraged. Doll, the goddess of your thoughts, is imprisoned in a horrible jail, tossed there by a heartless and filthy hand. Stoke up dark revenge from your deepest belly and set loose the serpents of hell. Doll is in. Pistol speaks nothing but the truth.']
['FALSTAFF', 'I’ll set her free.']
['PISTOL', 'That was the roar of the sea. The clanging trumpet sounds!']
['FALSTAFF', 'God save your grace, King Hal! My royal Hal!']
['PISTOL', 'The heavens guard and protect you, you royal child of fame!']
['FALSTAFF', 'God save you, my sweet boy!']
['PRINCE HENRY', 'My Lord Chief Justice, go speak to that arrogant man.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', ' (to FALSTAFF) Have you lost your mind? Do you know what you’re doing, talking like that?']
['FALSTAFF', 'My King! My God! I’m talking to you, my heart!']
['KING', 'I know you not, old man. Get down on your knees and pray, for white hair doesn’t sit well on a fool and a clown. I have dreamed about such a man for a long time: a man so swollen with excess, so old and so obscene. But now that I have awakened, I despise that dream. Let your body lessen, and your manners increase; leave behind your overindulgence, and know that the grave gapes three times as wide for you than any other man. Don’t answer me with a foolish joke. Do not assume that I am what I was; for God knows, I have turned my back on my former self, and I will do the same to those who were my companions. When you hear that I am as I was, then come to me, and you will once again be what you were: the teacher and nurse to my wild, riotous ways.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds.']
['SHALLOW', 'Yes, indeed, Sir John. And I’d like to take it home with me.']
['FALSTAFF', 'That can’t happen, Master Shallow. Don’t let this upset you; I’ll get a private invitation to see him. Look, he has to appear this way to the world. Don’t worry about your good fortunes: I’m still the man who will make you great.']
['SHALLOW', 'I don’t know how you’re going to do that, unless you give me your jacket and fill me out with stuffing. Please, Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Sir, I’m as good as my word. What you heard here a minute ago was just a color; it was a pretense.']
['SHALLOW', 'A color that I fear you’ll be buried in, Sir John.']
['FALSTAFF', 'Stop worrying about colors: come to lunch with me. Come, Lieutenant Pistol. Come, Bardolph. He’ll call for me tonight.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'Go, take Sir John Falstaff away to jail, and take all his companions with him.']
['FALSTAFF', 'My lord, my lord—']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'I can’t talk now. I’ll listen to you later. Take them away.']
['PISTOL', ' Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta“If fortune torments me, hope contents me.” Pistol’s motto is a garbled mix of French, Spanish and Italian.Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta.']
['LANCASTER', 'The King’s fair dealings please me. He wants to ensure that his old companions are provided for, but he banishes them until they can behave more properly and presentably.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'That they are.']
['LANCASTER', 'The King’s assembled his parliament, sir.']
['CHIEF JUSTICE', 'He has.']
['LANCASTER', 'I’ll bet that, before the year ends, we’ll launch an invasion of France. I heard a little bird singing about it, and I think the music pleased the King. Come, will you leave with me?']
