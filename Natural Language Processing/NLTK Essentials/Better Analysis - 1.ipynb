    "You have a girlfriend named Alma, who has a long tender horse neck and a big Dominican ass that seems to exist in a fourth dimension beyond jeans. An ass that could drag the moon out of orbit. An ass she never liked until she met you. Aint a day that passes that you dont want to press your face against that ass or bite the delicate sliding tendons of her neck. You love how she shivers when you bite, how she fights you with those arms that are so skinny they belong on an after-school special.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alma is a Mason Gross student, one of those Sonic Youth, comic-book-reading alternatinas without whom you might never have lost your virginity. Grew up in Hoboken, part of the Latino community that got its heart burned out in the eighties, tenements turning to flame. Spent nearly every teen-age day on the Lower East Side, thought it would always be home, but then N.Y.U. and Columbia both said nyet, and she ended up even farther from the city than before. She is in a painting phase, and the people she paints are all the color of mold, look like theyve just been dredged from the bottom of a lake. Her last painting was of you, slouching against the front door: only your frowning I-had-a-lousy-Third-World-childhood-and-all-I-got-was-this-attitude eyes recognizable. She did give you one huge forearm. I told you Id get the muscles in. The past couple of weeks, now that the warm is here, Alma has abandoned black, started wearing these nothing dresses made out of what feels like tissue paper; it wouldnt take more than a strong wind to undress her. She says she does it for you: Im reclaiming my Dominican heritage (which aint a complete lieshes even taking Spanish to better minister to your mom), and when you see her on the street, flaunting, flaunting, you know exactly what every nigger that walks by is thinking. You met at the weekly Latin parties at the DownUnder in New Brunswick. She never went to those parties, was dragged there by her high-school best friend, Patricia, who still listened to TKA, and this was how you got the chance to strike while, as your boys put it, the pussy was hot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alma is slender as a reed, you a steroid-addicted block; Alma loves driving, you books; Alma owns a Saturn (bought for her by her carpenter father, who speaks only English in the house), you have no points on your license; Almas nails are too dirty for cooking, your spaghetti con pollo is the best in the land. You are so very differentshe rolls her eyes every time you turn on the news and says she cant stand politics. She wont even call herself Hispanic. She brags to her girls that youre a radical and a real Dominican (even though on the Plátano Index you wouldnt rank, Alma being only the third Latina youve ever really dated). You brag to your boys that she has more albums than any of them do, that she says terrible white-girl things while you fuck. Shes more adventurous in bed than any girl youve had; on your first date she asked you if you wanted to come on her tits or her face, and maybe during boy training you didnt get one of the memos but you were, like, umm, neither. And at least once a week she will kneel on the mattress before you and, with one hand pulling at her dark nipples, will play with herself, not letting you touch at all, fingers whisking the soft of her and her face looking desperately, furiously happy. She loves to talk while shes being dirty, too, will whisper, You like watching me dont you, you like listening to me come, and when she finishes lets out this long demolished groan and only then will she allow you to pull her into an embrace as she wipes her gummy fingers on your chest. This is me, she says.\n",

Until one June day Alma discovers that you are also fucking this beautiful freshman girl named Laxmi, discovers the fucking of Laxmi because she, Alma, the girlfriend, opens your journal and reads. (Oh, she had her suspicions.) She waits for you on the stoop, and when you pull up in her Saturn and notice the journal in her hand your heart plunges through you like a fat bandit through a hangmans trap. You take your time turning off the car. You are overwhelmed by a pelagic sadness. Sadness at being caught, at the incontrovertible knowledge that she will never forgive you. You stare at her incredible legs and between them, to that even more incredible pópola youve loved so inconstantly these past eight months. Only when she starts walking over in anger do you finally step out. You dance across the lawn, powered by the last fumes of your outrageous sinvergüenzería. Hey, muñeca, you say, prevaricating to the end. When she starts shrieking, you ask her, Darling, what ever is the matter? She calls you:\n",

    "I AM a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.\t   1\n",
    "  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employées, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.\t   2\n",
    "  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquillity of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich mens bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astors good opinion.\t   3\n",
    "  Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my avocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct in the State of New-York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master of Chancery, by the new Constitution, as a  premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short years. But this is by the way.\t   4\n",
    "  My chambers were up stairs at No.  Wall-street. At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom. This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call life. But if so, the view from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.\t   5\n",
    "  At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem names, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve oclock, meridianhis dinner hourit blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals; and continued blazingbut, as it were, with a gradual wanetill 6 oclock, P. M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with the like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve oclock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table, boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like him. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all the time before twelve oclock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matchedfor these reasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however, because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent. Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve oclock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after twelve oclock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till tea-time. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured megesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the roomthat if his services in the morning were useful, how indispensible, then, in the afternoon?\t   6\n",
    "  With submission, sir, said Turkey on this occasion, I consider myself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.\t   7\n",
    "  But the blots, Turkey, intimated I.\t   8\n",
    "  True,but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old. Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs. Old ageeven if it blot the pageis honorable. With submission, sir, we both are getting old.\t   9\n",
    "  This appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, I saw that go he would not. So I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers.\t  10\n",
    "  Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I always deemed him the victim of two evil powersambition and indigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal documents. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions, hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked. Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get this table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting-paper. But no invention would answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to be rid of a scriveners table altogether. Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices courts, and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not be to handled. But while the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man with so small an income, could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time. As Nippers once observed, Turkeys money went chiefly for red ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed.\t  11\n",
    "  Though concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.\t  12\n",
    "  It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar causeindigestionthe irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that Turkeys paroxysms only coming on about twelve oclock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Nippers was on, Turkeys was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances.\t  13\n",
    "  Ginger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old. His father was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart, before he died. So he sent him to my office as student at law, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much. Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble science of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among the employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey and Nippers. Copying law papers being proverbially a dry, husky sort of business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger Nut very frequently for that peculiar cakesmall, flat, round, and very spicyafter which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when business was but dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafersindeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a pennythe scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me by making an oriental bow, and sayingWith submission, sir, it was generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account.\t  14\n",
    "  Now my original businessthat of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sortswas considerably increased by receiving the masters office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure nowpallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.\t  15\n",
    "  After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.\t  16\n",
    "  I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by myself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.\t  17\n",
    "  At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his application, had be been cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.\t  18\n",
    "  It is, of course, an indispensable part of a scriveners business to verify the accuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or more scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this examination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original. It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Byron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.\t  19\n",
    "  Now and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for this purpose. One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions. It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby. In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.\t  20\n",
    "  In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it was I wanted him to donamely, to examine a small paper with me. Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, I would prefer not to.\t  21\n",
    "  I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, I would prefer not to.\t  22\n",
    "  Prefer not to, echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the room with a stride. What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you to help me compare this sheet heretake it, and I thrust it towards him.\t  23\n",
    "  I would prefer not to, said he.\t  24\n",
    "  I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises. But as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I stood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my desk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my future leisure. So calling Nippers from the other room, the paper was speedily examined.\t  25\n",
    "  A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a weeks testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I called Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to Bartleby to join this interesting group.\t  26\n",
    "  Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.\t  27\n",
    "  I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.\t  28\n",
    "  What is wanted? said he mildly.\t  29\n",
    "  The copies, the copies, said I hurriedly. We are going to examine them. Thereand I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.\t  30\n",
    "  I would prefer not to, he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.\t  31\n",
    "  For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of my seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.\t  32\n",
    "  Why do you refuse?\t  33\n",
    "  I would prefer not to.\t  34\n",
    "  With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But there was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.\t  35\n",
    "  These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to you, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is common usage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you not speak? Answer!\t  36\n",
    "  I prefer not to, he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusion; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.\t  37\n",
    "  You are decided, then, not to comply with my requesta request made according to common usage and common sense?\t  38\n",
    "  He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound. Yes: his decision was irreversible.\t  39\n",
    "  It is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith. He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the other side. Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.\t  40\n",
    "  Turkey, said I, what do you think of this? Am I not right?\t  41\n",
    "  With submission, sir, said Turkey, with his blandest tone, I think that you are.\t  42\n",
    "  Nippers, said I, what do you think of it?\t  43\n",
    "  I think I should kick him out of the office.\t  44\n",
    "  (The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being morning, Turkeys answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Nippers replies in ill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous sentence, Nipperss ugly mood was on duty, and Turkeys off.)\t  45\n",
    "  Ginger Nut, said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf, what do you think of it?\t  46\n",
    "  I think, sir, hes a little luny, replied Ginger Nut, with a grin.\t  47\n",
    "  You hear what they say, said I, turning towards the screen, come forth and do your duty.\t  48\n",
    "  But he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But once more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the screen. And for his (Nipperss) part, this was the first and the last time he would do another mans business without pay.\t  49\n",
    "  Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there.\t  50\n",
    "  Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven oclock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartlebys screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat. The boy would then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.\t  51\n",
    "  He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly speaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby. Probably he preferred it should have none.\t  52\n",
    "  Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment. Even so, for the most part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange wilfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable with me. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:\t  53\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you.\t  54\n",
    "  I would prefer not to.\t  55\n",
    "  How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?\t  56\n",
    "  No answer.\t  57\n",
    "  I threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and Nippers, exclaimed in an excited manner\t  58\n",
    "  He says, a second time, he wont examine his papers. What do you think of it, Turkey?\t  59\n",
    "  It was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.\t  60\n",
    "  Think of it? roared Turkey; I think Ill just step behind his screen, and black his eyes for him!\t  61\n",
    "  So saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position. He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkeys combativeness after dinner.\t  62\n",
    "  Sit down, Turkey, said I, and hear what Nippers has to say. What do you think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing Bartleby?\t  63\n",
    "  Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may only be a passing whim.\t  64\n",
    "  Ah, exclaimed I, you have strangely changed your mind thenyou speak very gently of him now.\t  65\n",
    "  All beer, cried Turkey; gentleness is effects of beerNippers and I dined together to-day. You see how gentle I am, sir. Shall I go and black his eyes?\t  66\n",
    "  You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey, I replied; pray, put up your fists.\t  67\n",
    "  I closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.\t  68\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, wont you? (it was but a three minutes walk,) and see if there is any thing for me.\t  69\n",
    "  I would prefer not to.\t  70\n",
    "  You will not?\t  71\n",
    "  I prefer not.\t  72\n",
    "  I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?\t  73\n",
    "  Bartleby!\t  74\n",
    "  No answer.\t  75\n",
    "  Bartleby, in a louder tone.\t  76\n",
    "  No answer.\t  77\n",
    "  Bartleby, I roared.\t  78\n",
    "  Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\t  79\n",
    "  Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.\t  80\n",
    "  I prefer not to, he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.\t  81\n",
    "  Very good, Bartleby, said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended something of the kind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.\t  82\n",
    "  Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, had a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not toin other words, that he would refuse point-blank.\t  83\n",
    "  As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was this,he was always there;first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on Bartlebys part under which he remained in my office. Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, I prefer not to, was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perversenesssuch unreasonableness. However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.\t  84\n",
    "  Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.\t  85\n",
    "  Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk round to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, andpreferred not admitting me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.\t  86\n",
    "  Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?copying? Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that we would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.\t  87\n",
    "  Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat of a ricketty old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yet, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelors hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populousa sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!\t  88\n",
    "  For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a not-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad fancyingschimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brainled on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of Bartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scriveners pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.\t  89\n",
    "  Suddenly I was attracted by Bartlebys closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.\t  90\n",
    "  I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within. Every thing was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings bank.\t  91\n",
    "  I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him readingno, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallidhow shall I call it?of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.\t  92\n",
    "  Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul be rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.\t  93\n",
    "  I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby. Finally, I resolved upon this;I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, &c., and if he declined to answer then openly and reservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.\t  94\n",
    "  The next morning came.\t  95\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.\t  96\n",
    "  No reply.\t  97\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, in a still gentler tone, come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to doI simply wish to speak to you.\t  98\n",
    "  Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.\t  99\n",
    "  Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?\t 100\n",
    "  I would prefer not to.\t 101\n",
    "  Will you tell me any thing about yourself?\t 102\n",
    "  I would prefer not to.\t 103\n",
    "  But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me? I feel friendly towards you.\t 104\n",
    "  He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my head.\t 105\n",
    "  What is your answer, Bartleby? said I, after waiting a considerable time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.\t 106\n",
    "  At present I prefer to give no answer, he said, and retired into his hermitage.\t 107\n",
    "  It was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion nettled me. Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain disdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.\t 108\n",
    "  Again I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my office, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind. At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: Bartleby, never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:say so, Bartleby.\t 109\n",
    "  At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable, was his mildly cadaverous reply.\t 110\n",
    "  Just then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached. He seemed suffering from an unusually bad nights rest, induced by severer indigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.\t 111\n",
    "  Prefer not, eh? gritted NippersId prefer him, if I were you, sir, addressing meId prefer him; Id give him preferences, the stubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he prefers not to do now?\t 112\n",
    "  Bartleby moved not a limb.\t 113\n",
    "  Mr. Nippers, said I, Id prefer that you would withdraw for the present.\t 114\n",
    "  Somehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word prefer upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper aberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining me to summary means.\t 115\n",
    "  As Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly and deferentially approached.\t 116\n",
    "  With submission, sir, said he, yesterday I was thinking about Bartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers.\t 117\n",
    "  So you have got the word too, said I, slightly excited.\t 118\n",
    "  With submission, what word, sir, asked Turkey, respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing, making me jostle the scrivener. What word, sir?\t 119\n",
    "  I would prefer to be left alone here, said Bartleby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy.\t 120\n",
    "  Thats the word, Turkey, said Ithats it.\t 121\n",
    "  Oh, prefer? oh yesqueer word. I never use it myself. But, sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer\t 122\n",
    "  Turkey, interrupted I, you will please withdraw.\t 123\n",
    "  Oh, certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.\t 124\n",
    "  As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer. It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue. I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man, who already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of myself and clerks. But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission at once.\t 125\n",
    "  The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.\t 126\n",
    "  Why, how now? what next? exclaimed I, do no more writing?\t 127\n",
    "  No more.\t 128\n",
    "  And what is the reason?\t 129\n",
    "  Do you not see the reason for yourself, he indifferently replied.\t 130\n",
    "  I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed. Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision.\t 131\n",
    "  I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air. This, however, he did not do. A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office. But he blankly declined. So, much to my inconvenience, I went myself.\t 132\n",
    "  Still added days went by. Whether Bartlebys eyes improved or not, I could not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had permanently given up copying.\t 133\n",
    "  What! exclaimed I; suppose your eyes should get entirely wellbetter than ever beforewould you not copy then?\t 134\n",
    "  I have given up copying, he answered, and slid aside.\t 135\n",
    "  He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nayif that were possiblehe became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal. And when you finally quit me, Bartleby, added I, I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember.\t 136\n",
    "  At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Bartleby was there.\t 137\n",
    "  I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, The time has come; you must quit this place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.\t 138\n",
    "  I would prefer not, he replied, with his back still towards me.\t 139\n",
    "  You must.\t 140\n",
    "  He remained silent.\t 141\n",
    "  Now I had an unbounded confidence in this mans common honesty. He had frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs. The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary.\t 142\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.Will you take it? and I handed the bills towards him.\t 143\n",
    "  But he made no motion.\t 144\n",
    "  I will leave them here then, putting them under a weight on the table. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned and addedAfter you have removed your things from these offices, Bartleby, you will of course lock the doorsince every one is now gone for the day but youand if you please, slip your key underneath the mat, so that I may have it in the morning. I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter. Good-bye, Bartleby, and fare you well.\t 145\n",
    "  But he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple, he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted room.\t 146\n",
    "  As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly bidding Bartleby departas an inferior genius might have doneI assumed the ground that depart he must; and upon the assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my doubts,I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning. My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever,but only in theory. How it would prove in practicethere was the rub. It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Bartlebys departure; but, after all, that assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartlebys. The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do. He was more a man of preferences than assumptions.\t 147\n",
    "  AFTER breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities pro and con. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty. And so I kept veering about. At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.\t 148\n",
    "  Ill take odds he doesnt, said a voice as I passed.\t 149\n",
    "  Doesnt go?done! said I, put up your money.\t 150\n",
    "  I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty. In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were debating the same question with me. I passed on, very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary absent-mindedness.\t 151\n",
    "  As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood listening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the knob. The door was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be vanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success. I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which Bartleby was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from withinNot yet; I am occupied.\t 152\n",
    "  It was Bartleby.\t 153\n",
    "  I was thunderstruck. For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in mouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by summer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one touched him, when he fell.\t 154\n",
    "  Not gone! I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which ascendency, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,this too I could not think of. What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could assume in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the matter over with him again.\t 155\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, I am seriously displeased. I am pained, Bartleby. I had thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would sufficein short, an assumption. But it appears I am deceived. Why, I added, unaffectedly starting, you have not even touched the money yet, pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.\t 156\n",
    "  He answered nothing.\t 157\n",
    "  Will you, or will you not, quit me? I now demanded in a sudden passion, advancing close to him.\t 158\n",
    "  I would prefer not to quit you, he replied, gently emphasizing the not.\t 159\n",
    "  What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you pay my taxes? Or is this property yours?\t 160\n",
    "  He answered nothing.\t 161\n",
    "  Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step round to the post-office? In a word, will you do any thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?\t 162\n",
    "  He silently retired into his hermitage.\t 163\n",
    "  I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations. Bartleby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal actan act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have terminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associationsan uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of appearance;this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt.\t 164\n",
    "  But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another. Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principlea great safeguard to its possessor. Men have committed murder for jealousys sake, and angers sake, and hatreds sake, and selfishness sake, and spiritual prides sake; but no man that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charitys sake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct. Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he dont mean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.\t 165\n",
    "  I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to comfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past twelve oclock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge it? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.\t 166\n",
    "  Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into Edwards on the Will, and Priestley on Necessity. Under the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom. Yes, Bartleby, stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here. At least I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.\t 167\n",
    "  I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous. Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him. Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office, and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room. So after contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.\t 168\n",
    "  Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentlemans) office and fetch some papers for him. Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus.\t 169\n",
    "  Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his careful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to meditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination remained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.\t 170\n",
    "  What shall I do? I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last button. What shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I should do with this man, or rather ghost. Rid myself of him, I must; go, he shall. But how? You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive mortal,you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty? No, I will not, I cannot do that. Rather would I let him live and die here, and then mason up his remains in the wall. What then will you do? For all your coaxing, he will not budge. Bribes he leaves under your own paperweight on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he prefers to cling to you.\t 171\n",
    "  Then something severe, something unusual must be done. What! surely you will not have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent pallor to the common jail? And upon what ground could you procure such a thing to be done?a vagrant, is he? What! he a vagrant, a wanderer, who refuses to budge? It is because he will not be a vagrant, then, that you seek to count him as a vagrant. That is too absurd. No visible means of support: there I have him. Wrong again: for indubitably he does support himself, and that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do. No more then. Since he will not quit me, I must quit him. I will change my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, that if I find him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common trespasser.\t 172\n",
    "  Acting accordingly, next day I thus addressed him: I find these chambers too far from the City Hall; the air is unwholesome. In a word, I propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no longer require your services. I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another place.\t 173\n",
    "  He made no reply, and nothing more was said.\t 174\n",
    "  On the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers, and having but little furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be removed the last thing. It was withdrawn; and being folded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked room. I stood in the entry watching him a moment, while something from within me upbraided me.\t 175\n",
    "  I re-entered, with my hand in my pocketandand my heart in my mouth.\t 176\n",
    "  Good-bye, Bartleby; I am goinggood-bye, and God some way bless you; and take that, slipping something in his hand. But it dropped upon the floor, and then,strange to sayI tore myself from him whom I had so longed to be rid of.\t 177\n",
    "  Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked, and started at every footfall in the passages. When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key. But these fears were needless. Bartleby never came nigh me.\t 178\n",
    "  I thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited me, inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No.  Wall-street.\t 179\n",
    "  Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.\t 180\n",
    "  Then sir, said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, you are responsible for the man you left there. He refuses to do any copying; he refuses to do any thing; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses to quit the premises.\t 181\n",
    "  I am very sorry, sir, said I, with assumed tranquillity, but an inward tremor, but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to mehe is no relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me responsible for him.\t 182\n",
    "  In mercys name, who is he?\t 183\n",
    "  I certainly cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. Formerly I employed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some time past.\t 184\n",
    "  I shall settle him then,good morning, sir.\t 185\n",
    "  Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt a charitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me.\t 186\n",
    "  All is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through another week no further intelligence reached me. But coming to my room the day after, I found several persons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous excitement.\t 187\n",
    "  Thats the manhere he comes, cried the foremost one, whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.\t 188\n",
    "  You must take him away, sir, at once, cried a portly person among them, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of No.  Wall-street. These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any longer; Mr. B pointing to the lawyer, has turned him out of his room, and he now persists in haunting the building generally, sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by night. Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some fears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without delay.\t 189\n",
    "  Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have locked myself in my new quarters. In vain I persisted that Bartleby was nothing to meno more than to any one else. In vain:I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the terrible account. Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one person present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the lawyers) own room, I would that afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.\t 190\n",
    "  Going up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting upon the banister at the landing.\t 191\n",
    "  What are you doing here, Bartleby? said I.\t 192\n",
    "  Sitting upon the banister, he mildly replied.\t 193\n",
    "  I motioned him into the lawyers room, who then left us.\t 194\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?\t 195\n",
    "  No answer.\t 196\n",
    "  Now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something, or something must be done to you. Now what sort of business would you like to engage in? Would you like to re-engage in copying for some one?\t 197\n",
    "  No; I would prefer not to make any change.\t 198\n",
    "  Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?\t 199\n",
    "  There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a clerkship; but I am not particular.\t 200\n",
    "  Too much confinement, I cried, why you keep yourself confined all the time!\t 201\n",
    "  I would prefer not to take a clerkship, he rejoined, as if to settle that little item at once.\t 202\n",
    "  How would a bar-tenders business suit you? There is no trying of the eyesight in that.\t 203\n",
    "  I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not particular.\t 204\n",
    "  His unwonted wordiness inspirited me. I returned to the charge.\t 205\n",
    "  Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting bills for the merchants? That would improve your health.\t 206\n",
    "  No, I would prefer to be doing something else.\t 207\n",
    "  How then would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young gentleman with your conversation,how would that suit you?\t 208\n",
    "  Not at all. It does not strike me that there is any thing definite about that. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular.\t 209\n",
    "  Stationary you shall be then, I cried, now losing all patience, and for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly flying into a passion. If you do not go away from these premises before night, I shall feel boundindeed I am boundtototo quit the premises myself! I rather absurdly concluded, knowing not with what possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance. Despairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him, when a final thought occurred to meone which had not been wholly unindulged before.\t 210\n",
    "  Bartleby, said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, will you go home with me nownot to my office, but my dwellingand remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now, right away.\t 211\n",
    "  No: at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.\t 212\n",
    "  I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street towards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed from pursuit. As soon as tranquillity returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude persecution. I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have wished. So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria. In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for the time.\t 213\n",
    "  When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon the desk. I opened it with trembling hands. It informed me that the writer had sent to the police, and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant. Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he wished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the facts. These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me. At first I was indignant; but at last almost approved. The landlords energetic, summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not think I would have decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.\t 214\n",
    "  As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be conducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.\t 215\n",
    "  Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and headed by one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon.\t 216\n",
    "  The same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or to speak more properly, the Halls of Justice. Seeking the right officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described was indeed within. I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a perfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however unaccountably eccentric. I narrated all I knew, and closed by suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as possible till something less harsh might be donethough indeed I hardly knew what. At all events, if nothing else could be decided upon, the alms-house must receive him. I then begged to have an interview.\t 217\n",
    "  Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and especially in the inclosed grass-platted yards thereof. And so I found him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.\t 218\n",
    "  Bartleby!\t 219\n",
    "  I know you, he said, without looking round,and I want nothing to say to you.\t 220\n",
    "  It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby, said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion. And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it is not so sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and here is the grass.\t 221\n",
    "  I know where I am, he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I left him.\t 222\n",
    "  As I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron, accosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder saidIs that your friend?\t 223\n",
    "  Yes.\t 224\n",
    "  Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the prison fare, thats all.\t 225\n",
    "  Who are you? asked I, not knowing what to make of such an unofficially speaking person in such a place.\t 226\n",
    "  I am the grub-man. Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to provide them with something good to eat.\t 227\n",
    "  Is this so? said I, turning to the turnkey.\t 228\n",
    "  He said it was.\t 229\n",
    "  Well then, said I, slipping some silver into the grub-mans hands (for so they called him). I want you to give particular attention to my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can get. And you must be as polite to him as possible.\t 230\n",
    "  Introduce me, will you? said the grub-man, looking at me with an expression which seem to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding.\t 231\n",
    "  Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and asking the grub-man his name, went up with him to Bartleby.\t 232\n",
    "  Bartleby, this is Mr. Cutlets; you will find him very useful to you.\t 233\n",
    "  Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant, said the grub-man, making a low salutation behind his apron. Hope you find it pleasant here, sir;spacious groundscool apartments, sirhope youll stay with us some timetry to make it agreeable. May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your company to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets private room?\t 234\n",
    "  I prefer not to dine to-day, said Bartleby, turning away. It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners. So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.\t 235\n",
    "  Hows this? said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare of astonishment. Hes odd, aint he?\t 236\n",
    "  I think he is a little deranged, said I, sadly.\t 237\n",
    "  Deranged? deranged is it? Well now, upon my word, I thought that friend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale and genteel-like, them forgers. I cant help pity emcant help it, sir. Did you know Monroe Edwards? he added touchingly, and paused. Then, laying his hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, he died of consumption at Sing-Sing. So you werent acquainted with Monroe?\t 238\n",
    "  No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot stop longer. Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will see you again.\t 239\n",
    "  Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went through the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding him.\t 240\n",
    "  I saw him coming from his cell not long ago, said a turnkey, may be hes gone to loiter in the yards.\t 241\n",
    "  So I went in that direction.\t 242\n",
    "  Are you looking for the silent man? said another turnkey passing me. Yonder he liessleeping in the yard there. Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down.\t 243\n",
    "  The yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all sounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.\t 244\n",
    "  Strangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted Bartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.\t 245\n",
    "  The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. His dinner is ready. Wont he dine to-day, either? Or does he live without dining?\t 246\n",
    "  Lives without dining, said I, and closed the eyes.\t 247\n",
    "  Eh!Hes asleep, aint he?\t 248\n",
    "  With kings and counsellors, murmured I.\n",

    "  There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meagre recital of poor Bartlebys interment. But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrators making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear a few months after the scriveners decease. Upon what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without a certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The report was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters and assorting them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.\t 250\n",

    "          immy Nolan has a thing for broadsloud, brassy women who sit with their legs open and drink beer straight from the bottlewomen who always say exactly what theyre thinking and, for better or worse, mean what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy Nolan has a hard time meeting broads. Hes not quite sure if this is the result of geography, circumstance, or personal limitation. Jimmys ex-girlfriend Marissa was the antithesis of a broadpale, thin, precise, and polite with a watery voice and weak handshake. She says Jimmy isnt the kind of guy broads go for and, more than once during the course of their three-year relationship, she turned up her nose when Jimmy ogled a broad passing by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy Nolan would like to think he is the kind of guy broads go for. He likes his steak rare, enjoys a cold Budweiser, and has a hearty laugh that echoes in any room. His problem, however, is that he models himself after caricatures of who he thinks broads like. And, unfortunately for Jimmy, hes a nice guy. He opens doors and covers his lap with a napkin at dinner, never interrupts a conversation, and always says please and thank you. Then there are his handsslender, almost delicate hands that are finely veined, the skin stretched smoothly over bone without blemish.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this habit of placing his napkin on his lap that first got the attention of Greta, a waitress, a broad among broads, at his favorite diner. Greta is charmed by Jimmys manners and his demeanor, and how, even when he only comes in for coffee and a danish, he still takes the time to use his napkin properly. Greta doesnt claim to know much, but she knows men. She knows that their hands and their minds wander and that they will say most anything to get into the pants of a broad like her. Knowing so much about men is exhausting for Greta. Each day, when she sees Jimmy Nolan, Greta is grateful to see the kind of man she knows nothing about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy long ago decided his hands were the bane of his existence. Women like Marissa coo and fuss over them; they yearn for Jimmys lovely hands to toy with their tender bits. Marissas favorite thing was for Jimmy to lie next to her in bed, gently sucking one nipple while he stroked her clit with his middle finger in small, fast circles until the pleasure was so sharp and intense that it hurt. She couldnt get enough of Jimmys middle finger until, of course, she met someone who was happy to take Jimmys place. In Jimmys experience, the women in his life often find someone who can take his place. Broads, they take one look at Jimmy Nolans hands and decide that hands so fine would crumble inside their bodies. They hardly pay him any mind at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every night, Jimmy Nolan takes a bath. Its a ritual he has perfected over the years. At exactly 10:35 p.m., after the evening news is done, he runs hot water until the tub is three-quarters full and adds a capful of musky bath oil. He sets the radio to KSZU FM, a jazz stationreal jazz, not that new stuffand after stripping naked, sinks into the bath with a heavy sigh, enjoying the swirls of steam that fill the room. Jimmy bathes with his eyes closed, his long dark hair clinging to the ceramic edges of the tub. He fantasizes about trashy and brassy broadsimagines their mouths and breasts and thighs and eyes. In more explicit detail, he imagines Gretaa tall brunette with thick thighs, large green eyes, and oddly small yet perky breasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy doubts that Greta knows his name, but he leaves her a generous tip every day. He compliments her on the way she manages to dangle a cigarette between her lips and hold a conversation all while pouring coffee. As he thinks about Greta, he wraps his slender, almost delicate hands around the rigid length of his cockwhich is not at all delicateand slowly strokes himself. If he closes his eyes tight, he can pretend Greta is there with him, sliding into the tub, sighing as she relaxes. Jimmy knows that Greta has long days. What she needs at the end of that long day is a hot bath and a man like Jimmy Nolan waiting for her.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his mind, she sits across from him, smiling her slow, easy smile. She arches her leg just so, and traces Jimmys body from shoulder to shoulder with her big toe. Jimmy massages her foot, then her calf with his delicate hands. Greta moans softly, whispers, That feels so good. Gretas skin is slick, smooth, and he can feel the tension in her muscles as his hands move higher. Greta slides lower and pulls Jimmy toward her. He imagines her full lips, brushing against his neck as she straddles his lap, and slowly lowers herself onto his cock. Jimmy breathes slowly. He wants to make the moment last. He wraps his arms around Gretas strong frame, smiles to himself as she perches her chin over his shoulder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her ankles lock against his back and then, Greta fucks Jimmy like a broad should. She is exuberant, loud, and her thighs squeeze him so tightly Jimmy can hardly breathe. Jimmy rises to meet her thrusts, enjoys the wet sound of their bodies slapping together, water spilling onto the tiles. When shes about to come, Greta grabs hold of the sides of the tub, and lifts herself a bit, so that her breasts bounce against Jimmys face. He wraps his fingers in her thick, damp hair. She tells Jimmy to open his eyes, and she stares at him, her lips slightly parted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, when the fantasy of Greta has faded, there is a small constellation of grayish cum floating somewhere over his torso. Jimmy smokes a cigarette, thankful that his hands prove themselves useful on occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy has tried asking Greta out on a date. Imagined or not, he is certain that they share a connection. Greta has a habit of resting her hand against his narrow shoulder a little too long, smiling a bit too brightly when he passes through the grease-smudged doors, taking a seat across from him when theres a lull. During these lulls, Jimmy and Greta talk. He loosens his tie, rolls up his sleeves, and tries to flex his forearm muscles. They banter about work and politics and movies and life, and always Jimmy reminds her that his name is Jimmy Nolan. He knows that she has one kid, no husband, no boyfriend. She drinks Heineken, exclusively, likes clubbing when she can get a sitter, voted for Ralph Nader in the election, and plays a mean game of golf.\n",
    "\n",
    "What he does not know is that these conversations are the highlight of Gretas day. When shes home, after shes put her kid to bed, she stares out her bedroom window, looking past whats really there, and tries to recall every word Jimmy Nolan has ever said to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a very ordinary Thursday, after working late, Jimmy Nolan decides to stop by the diner, add a little variety to his routine. The place is nearly empty when he takes a seat at his regular booth. Greta is still working, though she looks a bit more worn than usual. Her long hair is unkempt, wayward strands creeping out of the ponytail that draws her features back. Light shadows line her eyes, and Jimmy imagines that this is what Greta must look like when she first wakes updrowsy and succulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta smiles when she sees Jimmy, leans against his table, and drawls, Jimmy Nolan, is it tomorrow already?\n",
    "\n",
    "So you do know my name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta cocks her head to the side and fishes her notepad from her waist. What can I get ya?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coffee. A burger, rare, with everything, and a side of onion rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "She pens his order, chewing on her lower lip, then taps the top of his head with her notepad and heads back to the kitchen. Jimmy watches her go, the way her hips rock back and forth. He hopes she knows he is watching. Greta hopes Jimmy is setting aside his polite ways long enough to watch. When she brings his food, the only other customer in the place, a tired-looking trucker with nicotine-stained fingers and a dent in his lower lip, pays his bill and leaves. Jimmy realizes with startling clarity that, save for the short-order cook watching TV in the kitchen, he and Greta are alone for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta sets Jimmys plate before him and takes a seat, pouring some ketchup on a napkin before sliding a finger through an onion ring and twirling it in the air. At last, she says, winking. Greta takes a bite of the onion ring and wills Jimmy Nolan to take an interest in something other than casual conversation with her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat creeps from his chest, up through his neck, and into his cheeks. He turns away and coughs as he assembles his hamburgerbun, ketchup, mustard, burger, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion, bun. The pickles, he eats separately, one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You play with your food the way I used to play with Legos, Greta says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy shrugs. I know how I like my food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta takes another bite of the onion ring she has stolen. Thats good, she says. That you know what you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy cant help but grin. Long day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta swings one leg out to the side, her blue skirt slowly inching up her thighs. Every day is a long day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy nods as if he can understand what its like to stand on your feet for ten hours a day, every day, but then, as he brings his burger to his mouth, he sees his hands and, blushing, quickly takes a bite, drops his food and hides his hands under the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta rubs her chin thoughtfully. I could try and devise a clever ploy to get you in the bathroom, but I already know how to unclog a toilet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy leans forward, one leg twitching uncontrollably. Why do you need to get me in the bathroom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta stands, smoothing her outfit. Follow me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Jimmy watches her walk away, stares down at his plate, and at the empty space across from him. He practically trips over his own feet as he extricates himself from the booth. His leg still twitching, he makes his way to the bathroom and pauses, studying the two doors before him. After a quick debate, he curses for quibbling with himself about which door shes behind and decides Greta will be in the ladies room. Greta is sitting over the sink, her ass against the faucet, legs slightly spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Took you long enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta laughs, and Jimmy shivers. She has a vulgar, voluptuous laugh, one that echoes like his. She reaches out and takes hold of the narrow length of his tie, pulling Jimmy closer. He stumbles forward, falling into her, his nose pressed against her cotton blouse. He inhales deeply. She smells like grease, tobacco smoke, lipstick, and a perfume hes never smelled beforea perfume only broads wear, he thinks. Shyly, Jimmy takes hold of Gretas waist and looks up at her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy Nolan, she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a deep breath, Jimmy brushes his lips across Gretas. He memorizes every faint groove, the way her full lips come to a point in the middle and never seem to close completely. Its been a long time since hes kissed any woman, and an even longer time since hes had the opportunity to kiss a woman properlywetly, with lots of tongue, hard enough to leave his lips swollen the next day. The tip of his tongue slips past her lips, and he traces the hard edges of her teeth before venturing further, finding her tongue, thick and flat, salty. Gretas legs spread further apart, and she wraps them around Jimmys waist before clasping the back of his neck, letting her long fingernails dig into his skin. Jimmy Nolan tries to become the kind of guy broads pick up in a diner. He undoes her ponytail and wraps her soft, thick hair around his fingers. He growls, as he feels her back arching, her breasts pressing against the flat of his chest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling her head back, Jimmy drags his fingers from the tip of Gretas chin, along the column of her throat, to the top of her blouse, hurriedly undoing each button, one of them flying off in the process and landing on the floor with a loud ping. Greta is silent but she kisses Jimmy with an intensity that frightens him. Beneath his slacks, his cock is hard against the soft fabric of his boxers. He brings his mouth lower, sinking his teeth into Gretas neck, pulling at the tight flesh, and tracing the red marks he makes with his tongue. In the morning, he wants Greta to stare at herself in the mirror and draw her fingers over the bruise he will leave. He wants the world to know Jimmy Nolan was here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy looks up for a moment. He almost doesnt recognize himself in the mirror. His face is flushed, a sheen of sweat covering his forehead and upper lip. His eyes are flashing, nostrils flaring. Greta tugs his tie again, and Jimmy takes her small breasts into his slender, almost delicate hands, enjoying the weight of them as his fingers follow the curves, squeezing softly. Reverently, he pulls each of Gretas nipples into his mouth. The textures of her body against his tongue send shivers down his spine and thighs. Greta presses her fingernails into his shoulders. Jimmy starts to nibble her nipples with his teeth, exerting just enough pressure to feel the taut flesh give way. He persists until Greta is moaning and grinding against the hollow sink beneath her. Jimmy rests his nose against Gretas breastbone. She smells different now.\n",
    "\n",
    "He doesnt bother removing her skirt. He knows how broads like it when theyre being fucked in bathrooms. She instinctively raises her ass as he shoves her skirt up around her waist. He can hardly control himself as he slides her panties, a purple, silky thongthe kind a broad wearsdown her legs, leaves them dangling from her ankle. Greta takes hold of one of Jimmys hands, and one by one, pulls his long fingers into her mouth to the third knuckle, lathing them with her tongue, grazing them with her teeth. She makes loud, sloppy sounds that remind him of her kisses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have beautiful hands, she whispers. The first thing I noticed about you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy is startled. He looks at his hand, in her mouth, imagines reaching into her body, reaching past the viscera in search of something he cant quite put to words. He cant help but say thank you. Greta takes the hand she is sucking, pushes it down the center of her body leaving a wide, moist trail. She firmly plants his hand against her cunt and stares at Jimmy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have beautiful hands, she says again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy nods silently and lowers his mouth between her thighs, licking the warm spaces between his splayed fingers. Greta shivers, and Jimmy shyly spreads his fingers, exposing the downy strip of her pussy lips. Sliding his tongue between them, he licks upwards. Her taste changes from subtle to thick and sharp along this intimate geography. Her clit, when he reaches it, is softer than he imagined, but sensitive, her thighs trembling each time his tongue passes over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your hands, Greta says hoarsely. Its your hands I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "He rises slightly and leans forward, resting his forehead against the upper swell of her breasts and slides two fingers inside Greta as he presses his thumb to her clit. She is tighttighter than he expectedand her wetness slides around his fingers like warm water. Greta is tracing his shoulders with her nails, and she has carefully wedged one of her feet between their bodies, pressing the arch against the hard length of his cock. Jimmy Nolan notes Gretas flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy slides a third finger inside Greta. She adjusts, spreading her legs wider. He twists his hand and arches his fingers upward, exploring the silky smoothness covering hard bone, the way her cunt curves. He tries to find the deepest, pulsing part of her, though he is not quite sure that such a thing is possible. The opening of Gretas cunt puckers around his fingers. Taking a deep breath, Jimmy lets his pinky slip inside of her. Slowly, at first, he begins to fuck her with his fingers, sliding them to the third knuckle then pulling back, then sliding back in. There is a sounda soft, squishy sound that Jimmy Nolan hopes he will never forget. Greta begins rocking her hips, and she moans a high-pitched, squeaky moan that borders on laughter. Her thighs are slick with sweat. The bathroom reeks of disinfectant, grease, and sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greta pounds her fist into Jimmys back. More, she says tersely. More.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy fucks Greta harder. Faster. The muscles in his arm burn from shoulder to wrist, but he doesnt stop. He presses his thumb against the palm of his hand and slides his entire, delicate, finely-boned hand inside Gretas cunt. His fingers curl into a fist, and Jimmy Nolan thinks it is a marvelous feeling, the sensation of Gretas insides clinging to his hand. Greta lifts Jimmys chin with one finger and forces him to look at her. Her expression is seriousone of intense concentration. Her eyes are cloudy, her lips open wide. Jimmy holds her gaze, grabbing Gretas ass with his other hand, thrusting his fist in and out of her with deliberate strokes that make her whole body tremble. Her moans are louder, throatier now. Jimmy does not know how much longer his arm will last, but he continues fucking Greta, rolling his fist around inside of her, rubbing his knuckles against the soft doughy pad just below her clit, his own hips rocking in rhythm with hers. His cock is throbbing, and he knows that soon, very soon, he will come all over his boxers, and he will have to walk home in the wet spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly Greta throws herself back, her head hitting the dirty mirror. Jimmy blinks. Her cunt spasms around his hand, wetness oozing over his wrist, trickling along his forearm. He leans down, licking some of the moisture. It is entirely satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont stop, Greta says, through clenched teeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy does as hes told and continues fucking Greta, but harder. His hand feels raw, knuckles chafed. He catches a glimpse of them in the mirror, their bodies at awkward angles, practically entwined. Jimmy likes what he sees. After a final husky groan, so low Jimmy can hardly hear it, Gretas body stills. He tries to pull his hand out, but Greta shakes her head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not yet, she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "They sit there, leaning against one another for a long while. Jimmy can hear the cook cleaning up the kitchen, leaving out the back door. They are silent, save for slow, heavy breathing. Finally, Greta kisses Jimmys chin and nods. Slowly, Jimmy slides his hand out of Gretas pussy. He traces the soft, exquisitely soft folds with his narrow pinky. Greta takes his wrist again, pulls her hand to her lips, kisses the open palm, then closes his fingers over the memory of her lips. He smiles widely. Jimmy Nolan is dizzy, delirious. He is slightly incredulous to be holding a broad like Greta in the palm of his slender, almost delicate hand.\n",

    "The neighborhood goes dark as I walk, and a second neighborhood unrolls atop the daytime one. We have few street lights, and those I pass under make my shadow frolic; it lags behind me, gallops to my feet, gambols on ahead. The only other illumination is from the windows in the houses I pass and the moon that orders me to look up, look up! Feral cats dart underfoot, bird-of-paradise flowers poke out of the shadows, smells are exhaled into the air: oak dust, slime mold, camphor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Northern Florida is cold in January and I walk fast for warmth but also because, although the neighborhood is antiquehuge Victorian houses radiating outward into nineteen-twenties bungalows, then mid-century modern ranches at the edgesits imperfectly safe. There was a rape a month ago, a jogger in her fifties pulled into the azaleas; and, a week ago, a pack of loose pit bulls ran down a mother with a baby in her stroller and mauled both, though not to death. Its not the dogs fault, its the owners fault! dog-lovers shouted on the neighborhood e-mail list, and its true, it was the owners fault, but also those dogs were sociopaths. When the suburbs were built, in the seventies, the historic houses in the center of the town were abandoned to graduate students who heated beans over Bunsen burners on the heart-pine floors and sliced apartments out of ballrooms. When neglect and humidity caused the houses to rot and droop and develop rusty scales, there was a second abandonment, to poor people, squatters. We moved here ten years ago because our house was cheap and had virgin-lumber bones, and because I decided that if I had to live in the South, with its boiled peanuts and its Spanish moss dangling like armpit hair, at least I wouldnt barricade myself with my whiteness in a gated community. Isnt it . . . dicey? people our parents age would say, grimacing, when we told them where we lived, and it took all my will power not to say, Do you mean black, or just poor? Because it was both.\n",
    "\n",

    "White middle-classness has since infected the neighborhood, though, and now everything is frenzied with renovation. In the past few years the black people have mostly withdrawn. The homeless stayed for a while, because our neighborhood abuts Bo Diddley Plaza, where, until recently, churches handed out food and God, and where Occupy rolled in like a tide and claimed the right to sleep there, then grew tired of being dirty and rolled out, leaving behind a human flotsam of homeless in sleeping bags. During our first months in the house, we hosted a homeless couple we only ever saw slinking off in the dawn: at dusk, they would silently lift off the latticework to the crawl space under our house and then sleep there, their roof our bedroom floor, and when we got up in the middle of the night we tried to walk softly because it felt rude to step inches above the face of a dreaming person.\n",

    "On my nighttime walks the neighbors lives reveal themselves, the lit windows domestic aquariums. At times, Im the silent witness to fights that look like slow-dancing without music. It is astonishing how people live, the messes they sustain, the delicious whiffs of cooking that carry to the street, the holiday decorations that slowly seep into daily décor. All January, I watched a Christmas bouquet of roses on one mantel diminish until the flowers were a blighted shrivel and the water green scum, a huge Santa on a stick still beaming merrily out of the ruins. Window after window nears, freezes with its blue fog of television light or its couple hunched over a supper of pizza, holds as I pass, then slides into the forgotten. I think of the way water gathers as it slips down an icicles length, pauses to build its glossy drop, becomes too fat to hang on, plummets down.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one mostly windowless place in the neighborhood, a yellow brick monstrosity that I love nevertheless, because it houses nuns. There used to be six nuns there, but attrition happened, as it does with very old ladies, and now there are only three kindly sisters squeaking around that immense space in their sensible shoes. A Realtor friend told us that when it was built, in the nineteen-fifties, a bomb shelter was lowered into the porous limestone of the back yard, and during sleepless nights, when my body is in bed but my brain is still out walking in the dark, I like to imagine the nuns in full regalia in their shelter, singing hymns and spinning on a stationary bike to keep the light bulb sputtering on, while, aboveground, all has been blasted black and rusted hinges rasp the wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the nights are so cold, I share the streets with few people. Theres a young couple who jog at a pace slightly slower than my fast walk. I follow them, listening to their patter of wedding plans and fights with friends. Once I forgot myself and laughed at something they said and their faces owled, unnerved, back at me, then they trotted faster and took the first turn they found and I let them disappear into the black.\n",

No matter how many times I find myself sailing past his window, there he is, his footsteps pounding so hard I can hear them from two blocks away. Because all the lights are on, to him there is nothing beyond the black in the window, and I wonder if he watches his reflection the way I watch him, if he sees how with each step his stomach ripples as if it were a pond into which someone had tossed a fist-size stone.\n",

    "And then theres the therapist who every night sits at his desk in the study of his Victorian, which looks like a rotting galleon. He was caught in bed with the wife of one of his patients; the patient had a loaded shotgun out in the car. The wife died in coitus and the therapist survived with a bullet still in his hip, which makes him lurch when he gets up to pour himself more Scotch. There are rumors that he visits the cuckolded murderer in prison every week, though whether his motive is kindness or crowing remains in the shadows, as if motives could ever be pure. My husband and I had just moved in when the murder occurred; we were scraping rotting paint off the oak moldings in our dining room when the gunshots splattered the air, but of course we believed they were fireworks lit by the kids who lived a few houses down.\n",

    "As I walk, I see strangers but also people I know. I look up in the beginning of February to see a close friend in a pink leotard in her window, stretching, but then, with a zip of understanding, I realize that she isnt stretching, she is drying her legs, and the leotard is in fact her body, pinked from the hot shower. Even though I visited her in the hospital when both of her boys were born, held the newborns in my arms when they still smelled of her, saw the raw Cesarean split, it isnt until I watch her drying herself that I understand that she is a sexual being, and then the next time we speak I cant help but blush and endure images of her in extreme sexual positions. Mostly, however, I see the mothers I know in glimpses, bent like shepherdess crooks, scanning the floor for tiny Legos or half-chewed grapes or the people they once were slumped in the corners.\n",

    "Its too much, its too much, I shout at my husband some nights when I come home, and he looks at me, afraid, this giant gentle man, and sits up in bed over his computer and says, softly, I dont think youve walked it off yet, sweets, you may want to take one more loop. I go out again, furious, because the streets become more dangerous this late at night, and how dare he suggest risk like this to me, when I have proved myself vulnerable; but, then again, perhaps my warm house has become more dangerous as well. During the day, while my sons are in school, I cant stop reading about the disaster of the world, the glaciers dying like living creatures, the great Pacific trash gyre, the hundreds of unrecorded deaths of species, millennia snuffed out as if they were not precious. I read and savagely mourn, as if reading could somehow sate this hunger for grief, instead of what it does, which is fuel it.\n",

    "I have mostly stopped caring where I walk, but I try to be at the Duck Pond every night when the Christmas lights, forgotten for weeks now, click off and the pond erupts, the frogs launching into their syncopated song like a nursery school let loose in a room of untuned lutes. Our pair of black swans would shout at the frogs with their brass voices as if to shut them up, but, outnumbered, the birds would soon give up and climb the island in the center of the pond and twine their necks together to sleep. The swans had four cygnets last spring, sweet cheeping puffs that were the delight of my little boys, who tossed dog food at them every day, until one morning, while the swans were distracted by our food, one cygnet gave a choked peep, bobbed, then went down; it came up again but across the pond, in the paws of an otter that ate it in small bites, floating serenely on its back. The otter got one more cygnet before the wildlife service arrived to scoop up the remaining two, but it was later reported in the neighborhood newsletter that the tiny swan hearts had given out in fear. The parent swans floated for months, inconsolable, though perhaps this is a projection, for, since they are both black swans and parents, they are already prefeathered in mourning.\n",

    "On Valentines Day, I see red and white lights flashing from afar at the nunnery and walk faster in the hope that the nuns are having a love party, a disco rager, but instead I see an ambulance drive away, and the next day my fears are confirmed: the nuns have been further diminished, to two. Withholding erotic pleasure for the glory of God seems an anachronism in our age of pleasure, and, with their frailty and the hugeness of the house they rattle around in, it has been decided that the remaining nuns must decamp. I come to watch them the night they leave, expecting a moving truck, but there are only a few leather suitcases and a box or two in the back of the nuns station wagon. Their wrinkled faces droop with relief as they drive off.\n",

    "The cold lingers on into March. It has been a hard winter for everyone, though not as terrible as in the North, and I think of my friends and family up there with their dirty walls of snow and try to remember that the camellias and peach trees and dogwoods and oranges are all abloom here, even in the dark. I smell the jasmine potent in my hair the next morning, the way I used to smell cigarette smoke and sweat after going to a night club, back when I was young and could do such unthinkable things. There is a vernacular style of architecture, called Cracker, which is not meant to cause offense, all porches and high ceilings; and by the middle of March one of the oldest Cracker houses in north-central Florida is being renovated. The façade is preserved, but the rest is gutted. Night by night, I see what remains of the house as daily it is stripped away, until one night the house has entirely vanished: that morning it collapsed on a worker, who survived, like Buster Keaton, by standing in the window as the structure fell. I study the hole where a humble and unremarked history stood for so long, a house that watched the town press up, then grow around it, and I think of the construction worker who walked out of the collapse unhurt, what he was imagining. I think I know. One night just before Christmas I came home late after a walk and my husband was in the bathroom and I flipped open his computer and saw what I saw there, a conversation not meant for me, a snip of flesh that was not his, and without letting him know I was in the house I about-faced and went out again and walked until it was too cold to walk, until just before dawn, when the dew could easily have been ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, while I stand before the collapsed house, the woman with the Great Dane slides by through the dark, and I notice how aggressively pale she has become, so skinny her cheeks must touch inside her mouth, her wig askew to show a rind of scalp above the bangs. If she, in turn, notices the particular dark spike of my unrest, she says only a soft good night and her dog looks at me with a kind of human compassion, and together they move off, stately and gentle, into the black.\n",

    "Most changes are not so swift as the fallen house, and I notice how much weight the boy in his glassed-in sunporch has lost only when I realize from the sound of his footsteps that hes no longer walking on his treadmill but running, and I look at him closely for the first time in a long time, my dear flabby friend whom I took for granted, and see a transformation so astonishing its as if a maiden had turned into a birch tree or a stream. During these few months this overweight child has turned into a slender man with pectoral rosebuds on his chest, sweating, smiling at himself in the glass, and I yelp aloud because of the swiftness of youth, these gorgeous changes that insist that not everything is decaying faster than we can love it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I walk on and as the boys trotting noises fade I keep hearing a disquieting constant sound that I cant place. It is a sticky night: I shed my jacket last week, and it is only gradually that I understand that the noise is coming from the first air-conditioner turned on for the year. Soon theyll all be on, crouched like trolls under the windows, their collective tuneless hum drowning out the night birds and frogs, and time will leap forward and the night will grow more and more reluctant to descend and, in the cool linger of twilight, people longing for real air after the sickly fake cold all day will come out and I will no longer have my dangerous dark streets to myself. Theres a pleasant smell like campfires in the air, and I think that the old turpentine-pine forests that ring the city must be on fire, which happens once a year or so, and I wonder about all those poor birds seared out of their sleep and into the disorienting darkness. I discover the next morning that it was worse, a controlled burn over the acres where dozens of the homeless had been living in a tent city, and I walk down to look, but its all great oaks, lonely and blackened from the waist down in a plain of steaming charcoal. When I return and see the six-foot fences around Bo Diddley Plaza which had gone up that same night for construction, or so the signs say, it is clear that it is part of a larger plan, balletically executed. I stand squinting in the daylight wanting to yell, looking to find a displaced person. Please, I think, please let my couple come by, let me see their faces at last, let me take their arms. I want to make them sandwiches and give them blankets and tell them that its O.K., that they can live under my house. Im glad I cant find anyone later, when I remember that it is not a kind thing to tell human beings that they can live under your house.\n",

    "The week of heat proves temporary, a false start to the season. The weather again turns so clammy and cold that nobody else comes out and I shiver as I walk until I escape my chill by going into the drugstore for Epsom salts to soak my walking away. It is astonishing to enter the dazzling color, the ferocious heat after the chilly gray scale; to travel hundreds of miles over the cracked sidewalk and sparse palmetto and black path-crossing cats I dart away from, into this abundance with its aisles of gaudy trash and useless wrapping and plastic pull tabs that will one day end up in the throat of the earths last sea turtle. I find myself limping and the limp morphs into a kind of pained bopping because the music dredges up elementary school, when my parents were, astonishingly, younger than I am now, and that one long summer they listened on repeat to Paul Simon singing over springy African drums about a trip with a son, the human trampoline, the window in the heart; and it is both too much and too little and I leave without the salts because I am not ready for such easy absolution as this. I cant.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so I walk and I walk and at some point, near the wildly singing frogs, I look up and out of the darkness, a stun: the new possessor of the old nunnery has installed uplighting, not on the aesthetic blank of the cube but, rather, on the ardent live oak in front of it, so old and so broad it spreads out over a half acre. Ive always known the tree was there, and my children have often swung on its low branches and from the bark plucked out ferns and epiphytes with which to adorn my head. But it has never before announced itself fully as the colossus it is, with its branches that are so heavy they grow toward the ground then touch and grow upward again; and thus, elbowing itself up, it brings to mind a woman at the kitchen table, knuckling her chin and dreaming. I stand shocked by its beauty, and, as I look, I imagine the swans on their island seeing the bright spark in the night and feeling their swan hearts moved. I heard that they have started building a nest again, though how they can bear it after all theyve lost I do not know.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope they understand, my sons, both now and in the future just materializing in the dark, that all these hours their mother has been walking so swiftly away from them I have not been gone, that my spirit, hours ago, slipped back into the house and crept into the room where their early-rising father had already fallen asleep, usually before 8 p.m., and that I touched this gentle man whom I love so desperately and somehow fear so much, touched him on the pulse in his temple and felt his dreams, which are too distant for the likes of me, and I climbed the creaking old stairs and at the top split in two and, heading right and left into separate rooms, slid through the crack under the doors and curled myself on the pillows to breathe into me the breath my boys breathed out. Every pause between the end of one breath and the beginning of the next is long; then again, nothing is not always in transition. Soon, tomorrow, the boys will be men, then the men will leave the house, and my husband and I will look at each other crouching under the weight of all that we wouldnt or couldnt yell, and all those hours outside walking, my body, my shadow, and the moon. It is terribly true, even if the truth does not comfort, that if you look at the moon for long enough night after night, as I have, you will see that the old cartoons are correct, that the moon is, in fact, laughing, but not at us, we who are too small and our lives too fleeting for it to give us any notice at all. ?\n",

    "Marys eyes dont react to the ophthalmoscope. One E.M.T. listens to her nonexistent heartbeat, and the other takes her nonexistent blood pressure. It goes on like that for a while. The teen-agers come back with some of their friends. Other people, too. Ray guesses theyre being drawn by the flashing red lights on top of the Suburban the way bugs are drawn to a porch light. Mr. Ghosh takes another run at them, flapping his arms. They back away again. Then, when Mr. Ghosh returns to the circle around Mary and Ray, they come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the E.M.T.s says to Ray, She was your wife?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, sir, Im sorry to say that shes dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary, Mother of God, the fat lady with the Bugles says. She crosses herself.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mr. Ghosh offers one of the E.M.T.s the souvenir T-shirt to put over Marys face, but the E.M.T. shakes his head and goes outside. He tells the little crowd that theres nothing to see, as if anyones going to believe a dead woman on the Quik-Pik floor isnt interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The E.M.T. yanks a gurney from the back of the rescue vehicle. He does it with a single flip of the wrist. The legs fold down all by themselves. The old man with the thinning hair holds the door open and the E.M.T. pulls his rolling deathbed inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whoo, hot, the E.M.T. says, wiping his forehead.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to turn away for this part, sir, the other one says, but Ray watches as they lift her onto the gurney. A sheet has been tucked down at the end of it. They pull it up all the way, until its over her face. Now Mary looks like a corpse in a movie. They roll her out into the heat. This time, the fat woman with the Bugles holds the door for them. The crowd has retreated to the sidewalk. There must be three dozen people standing in the unrelieved August sunshine.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Mary is stored, the E.M.T.s come back. One is holding a clipboard. He asks Ray about twenty-five questions. Ray can answer all but the one about her age. Then he remembers shes three years younger than he is and tells them thirty-five.\n",
    "\n",
    "Were going to take her to St. Stevies, the E.M.T. with the clipboard says. You can follow us if you dont know where that is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, Ray says. What? Do you want to do an autopsy? Cut her up?\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl in the blue smock gives a gasp. Mr. Ghosh puts his arm around her, and she puts her face against his white shirt. Ray wonders if Mr. Ghosh is fucking her. He hopes not. Not because of Mr. Ghoshs brown skin but because hes got to be twice her age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, thats not our decision, the E.M.T. says, but probably not. She didnt die unattended\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill say, the woman with the Bugles interjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "and its pretty clearly a heart attack. You can probably have her released to the mortuary almost immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mortuary? An hour ago they were in the car, arguing. I dont have a mortuary, Ray says. Not a mortuary, a burial plot, nothing. What the hell? Shes thirty-five.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two E.M.T.s exchange a look. Mr. Burkett, therell be someone to help you with all that at St. Stevies. Dont worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The E.M.T. wagon pulls out with the lights still flashing but the siren off. The crowd on the sidewalk starts to break up. The countergirl, the old man, the fat woman, and Mr. Ghosh look at Ray as though hes someone special. A celebrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "She wanted a purple kickball for our niece, he says. Shes having a birthday. Shell be eight. Her name is Talia. Tallie for short. She was named for an actress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ghosh takes a purple kickball from the wire rack and holds it out to Ray in both hands. On the house, he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, sir, Ray says, trying to sound equally solemn, and the woman with the Bugles bursts into tears. Mary, Mother of God, she says. She likes that one.\n",
    "\n",
    "They stand around for a while, talking. Mr. Ghosh gets sodas from the cooler. These are also on the house. They drink their sodas and Ray tells them a few things about Mary. He tells them how she made a quilt that took third prize at the Castle County fair. That was in 02. Or maybe 03.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats so sad, the woman with the Bugles says. She has opened them and shared them around. They eat and drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "My wife went in her sleep, the old man with the thinning hair says. She just laid down on the sofa and never woke up. We were married thirty-seven years. I always expected Id go first, but thats not the way the good Lord wanted it. I can still see her laying there on the sofa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Ray runs out of things to tell them, and they run out of things to tell him. Customers are coming in again. Mr. Ghosh waits on some, and the woman in the blue smock waits on others. Then the fat woman says she really has to go. She gives Ray a kiss on the cheek before she does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to see to your business, Mr. Burkett, she tells him. Her tone is both reprimanding and flirtatious.\n",
    "\n",
    "He looks at the clock over the counter. Its the kind with a beer advertisement on it. Almost two hours have gone by since Mary went sidling between the car and the cinder-block side of the Quik-Pik. And for the first time he thinks of Biz.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he opens the door, heat rushes out at him, and when he puts his hand on the steering wheel to lean in he pulls it back with a cry. Its got to be a hundred and thirty in there. Biz is dead on his back. His eyes are milky. His tongue is protruding from the side of his mouth. Ray can see the wink of his teeth. There are little bits of coconut caught in his whiskers. That shouldnt be funny, but it is. Not funny enough to laugh at, but funny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biz, old buddy, he says. Im sorry. I forgot you were in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great sadness and amusement sweep over him as he looks at the baked Jack Russell. That anything so sad should be funny is just a crying shame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, youre with her now, aint you? he says, and this is so sad that he begins to cry. Its a hard storm. While hes crying, it comes to him that now he can smoke all he wants, and anywhere in the house. He can smoke right there at her dining-room table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Youre with her now, Biz, he says again through his tears. His voice is clogged and thick. Its a relief to sound just right for the situation. Poor old Mary, poor old Biz. Damn it all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Still crying, and with the purple kickball still tucked under his arm, he goes back into the Quik-Pik. He tells Mr. Ghosh he forgot to get cigarettes. He thinks maybe Mr. Ghosh will give him a pack of Premium Harmonys on the house as well, but Mr. Ghoshs generosity doesnt stretch that far. Ray smokes all the way to the hospital with the windows shut and the air-conditioning on. ?\n",

    "          or the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent triflea basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\n",

    "At the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\n",

    "That Friday, their sons birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengersa girl with dark hair and grubby red toenailswas weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiksin Minsk, years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctors words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. Referential mania, the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\n",

She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\n",

    "In silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\n",

    "When he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fiancé fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged sixthat was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at tenthe year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cant sleep! he cried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why cant you sleep? she asked. You were so tired.\n",

    "I cant sleep because I am dying, he said, and lay down on the couch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?\n",
    "\n",
    "No doctors, no doctors, he moaned. To the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, well be responsible.... Responsible! He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right, she said quietly. We will bring him home tomorrow morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like some tea, said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floorthe knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, I have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He wont have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\n",

    "\n",
    "She put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. It frightened me, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\n",

    "They sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and reëxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labelsapricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to crab apple when the telephone rang again. ?\n",

    "          For longer than anyone could remember, the village of Yiwei had worn, in its orchards and under its eaves, clay-colored globes of paper that hissed and fizzed with wasps. The villagers maintained an uneasy peace with their neighbors for many years, exercising inimitable tact and circumspection. But it all ended the day a boy, digging in the riverbed, found a stone whose balance and weight pleased him. With this, he thought, he could hit a sparrow in flight. There were no sparrows to be seen, but a paper ball hung low and inviting nearby. He considered it for a moment, head cocked, then aimed and threw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much later, after he had been plastered and soothed, his mother scalded the fallen nest until the wasps seething in the paper were dead. In this way it was discovered that the wasp nests of Yiwei, dipped in hot water, unfurled into beautifully accurate maps of provinces near and far, inked in vegetable pigments and labeled in careful Mandarin that could be distinguished beneath a microscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The villagers' subsequent incursions with bee veils and kettles of boiling water soon diminished the prosperous population to a handful. Commanded by a single stubborn foundress, the survivors folded a new nest in the shape of a paper boat, provisioned it with fallen apricots and squash blossoms, and launched themselves onto the river. Browsing cows and children fled the riverbanks as they drifted downstream, piping sea chanteys.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, forty miles south from where they had begun, their craft snagged on an upthrust stick and sank. Only one drowned in the evacuation, weighed down with the remains of an apricot. They reconvened upon a stump and looked about themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's a good place to land,\" the foundress said in her sweet soprano, examining the first rough maps that the scouts brought back. There were plenty of caterpillars, oaks for ink galls, fruiting brambles, and no signs of other wasps. A colony of bees had hived in a split oak two miles away. \"Once we are established we will, of course, send a delegation to collect tribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We will not make the same mistakes as before. Ours is a race of explorers and scientists, cartographers and philosophers, and to rest and grow slothful is to die. Once we are established here, we will expand.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It took two weeks to complete the nurseries with their paper mobiles, and then another month to reconstruct the Great Library and fill the pigeonholes with what the oldest cartographers could remember of their lost maps. Their comings and goings did not go unnoticed. An ambassador from the beehive arrived with an ultimatum and was promptly executed; her wings were made into stained-glass windows for the council chamber, and her stinger was returned to the hive in a paper envelope. The second ambassador came with altered attitude and a proposal to divide the bees' kingdom evenly between the two governments, retaining pollen and water rights for the bees\"as an acknowledgment of the preexisting claims of a free people to the natural resources of a common territory,\" she hummed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wasps of the council were gracious and only divested the envoy of her sting. She survived just long enough to deliver her account to the hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third ambassador arrived with a ball of wax on the tip of her stinger and was better received.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You understand, we are not refugees applying for recognition of a token territorial sovereignty,\" the foundress said, as attendants served them nectars in paper horns, \"nor are we negotiating with you as equal states. Those were the assumptions of your late predecessors. They were mistaken.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\"Unlike them, I have complete authority to speak for the hive. You have propositions for us; that is clear enough. We are prepared to listen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, good.\" The foundress drained her horn and took another. \"Yours is an old and highly cultured society, despite the indolence of your ruler, which we understand to be a racial rather than personal proclivity. You have laws, and traditional dances, and mathematicians, and principles, which of course we do respect.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your terms, please.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She smiled. \"Since there is a local population of tussah moths, which we prefer for incubation, there is no need for anything so unrepublican as slavery. If you refrain from insurrection, you may keep your self-rule. But we will take a fifth of your stores in an ordinary year, and a tenth in drought years, and one of every hundred larvae.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To eat?\" Her antennae trembled with revulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Only if food is scarce. No, they will be raised among us and learn our ways and our arts, and then they will serve as officials and bureaucrats among you. It will be to your advantage, you see.\"\n",

    "The diplomat paused for a moment, looking at nothing at all. Finally she said, \"A tenth, in a good year\"\n",

    "\"The choice is enslavement or cooperation,\" the foundress said. \"For your hive, I mean. You might choose something else, certainly, but they have tens of thousands to replace you with.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The diplomat bent her head. \"I am old,\" she said. \"I have served the hive all my life, in every fashion. My loyalty is to my hive and I will do what is best for it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am so very glad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I ask youI beg youto wait three or four days to impose your terms. I will be dead by then, and will not see my sisters become a servile people.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundress clicked her claws together. \"Is the delaying of business a custom of yours? We have no such practice. You will have the honor of watching us elevate your sisters to moral and technological heights you could never imagine.\"\n",

    "The terms of the relationship were copied out, at the wasps' direction, on small paper plaques embedded in propolis and wax around the hive. As paper and ink were new substances to the bees, they jostled and touched and tasted the bills until the paper fell to pieces. The wasps sent to oversee the installation did not take this kindly. Several civilians died before it was established that the bees could not read the Yiwei dialect.\n",

    "Thereafter the hive's chemists were charged with compounding pheromones complex enough to encode the terms of the treaty. These were applied to the papers, so that both species could inspect them and comprehend the relationship between the two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the hive before the wasp infestation had been busy but content, the bees now lived in desperation. The natural terms of their lives were cut short by the need to gather enough honey for both the hive and the wasp nest. As they traveled farther and farther afield in search of nectar, they stopped singing. They danced their findings grimly, without joy. The queen herself grew gaunt and thin from breeding replacements, and certain ministers who understood such matters began feeding royal jelly to the strongest larvae.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the wasps grew sleek and strong. Cadres of scholars, cartographers, botanists, and soldiers were dispatched on the river in small floating nests caulked with beeswax and loaded with rations of honeycomb to chart the unknown lands to the south. Those who returned bore beautiful maps with towns and farms and alien populations of wasps carefully noted in blue and purple ink, and these, once studied by the foundress and her generals, were carefully filed away in the depths of the Great Library for their southern advance in the new year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bees adopted by the wasps were first trained to clerical tasks, but once it was determined that they could be taught to read and write, they were assigned to some of the reconnaissance missions. The brightest students, gifted at trigonometry and angles, were educated beside the cartographers themselves and proved valuable assistants. They learned not to see the thick green caterpillars led on silver chains, or the dead bees fed to the wasp brood. It was easier that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the old queen died, they did not mourn.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the sheerest of accidents, one of the bees trained as a cartographer's assistant was an anarchist. It might have been the stresses on the hive, or it might have been luck; wherever it came from, the mutation was viable. She tucked a number of her own eggs in beeswax and wasp paper among the pigeonholes of the library and fed the larvae their milk and bread in secret. To her sons in their capped silk cradlesand they were all sonsshe whispered the precepts she had developed while calculating flight paths and azimuths, that there should be no queen and no state, and that, as in the wasp nest, the males should labor and profit equally with the females. In their sleep and slow transformation they heard her teachings and instructions, and when they chewed their way out of their cells and out of the wasp nest, they made their way to the hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The damage to the nest was discovered, of course, but by then the anarchist was dead of old age. She had done impeccable work, her tutor sighed, looking over the filigree of her inscriptions, but the brilliant were subject to mental aberrations, were they not? He buried beneath grumblings and labors his fondness for her, which had become a grief to him and a political liability, and he never again took on any student from the hive who showed a glint of talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they had the bitter smell of the wasp nest in their hair, the anarchist's twenty sons were permitted to wander freely through the hive, as it was assumed that they were either spies or on official business. When the new queen emerged from her chamber, they joined unnoticed the other drones in the nuptial flight. Two succeeded in mating with her. Those who failed and survived spoke afterward in hushed tones of what had been done for the sake of the ideal. Before they died they took propolis and oak-apple ink and inscribed upon the lintels of the hive, in a shorthand they had developed, the story of the first anarchist and her twenty sons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anarchism being a heritable trait in bees, a number of the daughters of the new queen found themselves questioning the purpose of the monarchy. Two were taken by the wasps and taught to read and write. On one of their visits to the hive they spotted the history of their forefathers, and, being excellent scholars, soon figured out the translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "They found their sisters in the hive who were unquiet in soul and whispered to them the strange knowledge they had learned among the wasps: astronomy, military strategy, the state of the world beyond the farthest flights of the bees. Hitherto educated as dancers and architects, nurses and foragers, the bees were full of a new wonder, stranger even than the first day they flew from the hive and felt the sun on their backs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Govern us,\" they said to the two wasp-taught anarchists, but they refused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A perfect society needs no rulers,\" they said. \"Knowledge and authority ought to be held in common. In order to imagine a new existence, we must free ourselves from the structures of both our failed government and the unjustifiable hegemony of the wasp nests. Hear what you can hear and learn what you can learn while we remain among them. But be ready.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the first summer in Yiwei without the immemorial hum of the cartographer wasps. In the orchards, though their skins split with sweetness, fallen fruit lay unmolested, and children played barefoot with impunity. One of the villagers' daughters, in her third year at an agricultural college, came home in the back of a pickup truck at the end of July. She thumped her single suitcase against the gate before opening it, to scatter the chickens, then raised the latch and swung the iron aside, and was immediately wrapped in a flying hug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once she disentangled herself from brother and parents and liberally distributed kisses, she listened to the news she'd missed: how the cows were dying from drinking stonecutters' dust in the streams; how grain prices were falling everywhere, despite the drought; and how her brother, little fool that he was, had torn down a wasp nest and received a faceful of red and white lumps for it. One of the most detailed wasp's maps had reached the capital, she was told, and a bureaucrat had arrived in a sleek black car. But because the wasps were all dead, he could report little more than a prank, a freak, or a miracle. There were no further inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her brother produced for her inspection the brittle, boiled bodies of several wasps in a glass jar, along with one of the smaller maps. She tickled him until he surrendered his trophies, promised him a basket of peaches in return, and let herself be fed to tautness. Then, to her family's dismay, she wrote an urgent letter to the Academy of Sciences and packed a satchel with clothes and cash. If she could find one more nest of wasps, she said, it would make their fortune and her name. But it had to be done quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the morning, before the cockerels woke and while the sky was still purple, she hopped onto her old bicycle and rode down the dusty path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bees do not fly at night or lie to each other, but the anarchists had learned both from the wasps. On a warm, clear evening they left the hive at last, flying west in a small tight cloud. Around them swelled the voices of summer insects, strange and disquieting. Several miles west of the old hive and the wasp nest, in a lightning-scarred elm, the anarchists had built up a small stock of stolen honey sealed in wax and paper. They rested there for the night, in cells of clean white wax, and in the morning they arose to the building of their city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first business of the new colony was the laying of eggs, which a number of workers set to, and provisions for winter. One egg from the old queen, brought from the hive in an anarchist's jaws, was hatched and raised as a new mother. Uncrowned and unconcerned, she too laid mortar and wax, chewed wood to make paper, and fanned the storerooms with her wings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anarchists labored secretly but rapidly, drones alongside workers, because the copper taste of autumn was in the air. None had seen a winter before, but the memory of the species is subtle and long, and in their hearts, despite the summer sun, they felt an imminent darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowers were fading in the fields. Every day the anarchists added to their coffers of warm gold and built their white walls higher. Every day the air grew a little crisper, the grass a little drier. They sang as they worked, sometimes ballads from the old hive, sometimes anthems of their own devising, and for a time they were happy. Too soon, the leaves turned flame colors and blew from the trees, and then there were no more flowers. The anarchists pressed down the lid on the last vat of honey and wondered what was coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four miles away, at the first touch of cold, the wasps licked shut their paper doors and slept in a tight knot around the foundress. In both beehives, the bees huddled together, awake and watchful, warming themselves with the thrumming of their wings. The anarchists murmured comfort to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There will be more, after us. It will breed out again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We are only the beginning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There will be more.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow fell silently outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snow was ankle-deep and the river iced over when the girl from Yiwei reached up into the empty branches of an oak tree and plucked down the paper castle of a nest. The wasps within, drowsy with cold, murmured but did not stir. In their barracks the soldiers dreamed of the unexplored south and battles in strange cities, among strange peoples, and scouts dreamed of the corpses of starved and frozen deer. The cartographers dreamed of the changes that winter would work on the landscape, the diverted creeks and dead trees they would have to note down. They did not feel the burlap bag that settled around them, nor the crunch of tires on the frozen road.\n",
    "\n",
    "She had spent weeks tramping through the countryside, questioning beekeepers and villagers' children, peering up into trees and into hives, before she found the last wasps from Yiwei. Then she had had to wait for winter and the anesthetizing cold. But now, back in the warmth of her own room, she broke open the soft pages of the nest and pushed aside the heaps of glistening wasps until she found the foundress herself, stumbling on uncertain legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it thawed, she would breed new foundresses among the village's apricot trees. The letters she received indicated a great demand for them in the capital, particularly from army generals and the captains of scientific explorations. In years to come, the village of Yiwei would be known for its delicately inscribed maps, the legends almost too small to see, and not for its barley and oats, its velvet apricots and glassy pears.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spring, the old beehive awoke to find the wasps gone, like a nightmare that evaporates by day. It was difficult to believe, but when not the slightest scrap of wasp paper could be found, the whole hive sang with delight. Even the queen, who had been coached from the pupa on the details of her client state and the conditions by which she ruled, and who had felt, perhaps, more sympathy for the wasps than she should have, cleared her throat and trilled once or twice. If she did not sing so loudly or so joyously as the rest, only a few noticed, and the winter had been a hard one, anyhow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maps had vanished with the wasps. No more would be made. Those who had studied among the wasps began to draft memoranda and the first independent decrees of queen and council. To defend against future invasions, it was decided that a detachment of bees would fly the borders of their land and carry home reports of what they found.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was on one of these patrols that a small hive was discovered in the fork of an elm tree. Bees lay dead and brittle around it, no identifiable queen among them. Not a trace of honey remained in the storehouse; the dark wax of its walls had been gnawed to rags. Even the brood cells had been scraped clean. But in the last intact hexagons they found, curled and capped in wax, scrawled on page after page, words of revolution. They read in silence.\n",

    "          '''THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at the thought of his immolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "I said to him --\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How?\" said he. \"Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\"I have no engagement; --come.\"\n",

    "\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\"\n",

    "\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n",

    "Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\n",

    "\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And I to your long life.\"\n",

    "He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n",

    "\"I forget your arms.\"\n",

    "\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good!\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough --\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement --a grotesque one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not I,\" I replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are not of the masons.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You? Impossible! A mason?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A mason,\" I replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is this,\" I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchresi --\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\n",
    "\n",
    "A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said--\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ha! ha! ha! --he! he! he! --a very good joke, indeed --an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he! he! he! --over our wine --he! he! he!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He! he! he! --he! he! he! --yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For the love of God, Montresor!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud --\n",

    "\n",
    "No answer. I called again --\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fortunato!\"\n",

    "No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat! \n",

Smiley is a myth; that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured that, if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be useless to me.

    "Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling, was exquisitely absurd. As I said before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once:\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a feller here once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49 or may be it was the spring of '50 I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't, he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit him any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solittry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and -take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him he would bet on any thing the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn's going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley asked how she was, and he said she was considerable better thank the Lord for his inftnit mercy and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of Providence, she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, \"Well, I'll risk two- and-a-half that she don't, any way.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thish-yer Smiley had a mare the boys called her the fifteen- minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate- like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he wan's worth a cent, but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him, he was a different dog; his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him, and bully- rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson which was the name of the pup Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze on it not chew, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off by a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet bolt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peered sur- prised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take bolt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him, and he had genius I know it, because he hadn't had no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom- cats, and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of catching flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most any thing and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog and sing out, \"Flies, Dan'l, flies!\" and quicker'n you could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightforward as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller a stranger in the camp, he was come across him with his box, and says:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What might it be that you've got in the box?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, \"It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may be, but it an't it's only just a frog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, \"H'm so 'tis. Well, what's he good for?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well,\" Smiley says, easy and careless, \"He's good enough for one thing, I should judge he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, \"Well, I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"May be you don't,\" Smiley says. \"May be you understand frogs, and may be you don't understand 'em; may be you've had experience, and may be you an't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, \"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I an't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And then Smiley says, \"That's all right that's all right if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.\" And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a tea- spoon and filled him full of quail shot filled him pretty near up to his chin and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore- paws just even with Dan'l, and I'll give the word.\" Then he says, \"One two three jump!\" and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders so like a Frenchman, but it wan's no use he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulders this way at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, \"Well, I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, \"I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for I wonder if there an't something the matter with him he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.\" And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, \"Why, blame my cats, if he don't weigh five pound!\" and turned him upside down, and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And-\n",

    "[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: \"Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy I an't going to be gone a second.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away.\n",

    "          LILY, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies' dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan's annual dance. Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia's choir, any of Kate's pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane's pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher's Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. Lily, the caretaker's daughter, did housemaid's work for them. Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane's pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, Mr. Conroy,\" said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, \"Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'll engage they did,\" said Gabriel, \"but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Miss Kate, here's Mrs. Conroy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel's wife, said she must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I'll follow,\" called out Gabriel from the dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?\" asked Lily.\n",
    "\n",
    "She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim; growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, Lily,\" he answered, \"and I think we're in for a night of it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Tell me. Lily,\" he said in a friendly tone, \"do you still go to school?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O no, sir,\" she answered. \"I'm done schooling this year and more.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, then,\" said Gabriel gaily, \"I suppose we'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh? \"\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O Lily,\" he said, thrusting it into her hands, \"it's Christmastime, isn't it? Just... here's a little....\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He walked rapidly towards the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O no, sir!\" cried the girl, following him. \"Really, sir, I wouldn't take it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Christmas-time! Christmas-time!\" said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, thank you, sir.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl's bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies' dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her face, healthier than her sister's, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "They both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gretta tells me you're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" said Gabriel, turning to his wife, \"we had quite enough of that last year, hadn't we? Don't you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,\" she said. \"You can't be too careful.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But as for Gretta there,\" said Gabriel, \"she'd walk home in the snow if she were let.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Conroy laughed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Don't mind him, Aunt Kate,\" she said. \"He's really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom's eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you'll never guess what he makes me wear now!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Goloshes!\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't. The next thing he'll buy me will be a diving suit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew's face. After a pause she asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what are goloshes, Gabriel?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Goloshes, Julia!\" exclaimed her sister \"Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, on the Continent,\" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But tell me, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. \"Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"0, the room is all right,\" replied Gabriel. \"I've taken one in the Gresham.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate, \"by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"0, for one night,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Besides, Bessie will look after them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate again. \"What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her lately. She's not the girl she was at all.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, I ask you,\" she said almost testily, \"where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here's Freddy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he's all right, and don't let him up if he's screwed. I'm sure he's screwed. I'm sure he is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's such a relief,\" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, \"that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he's here.... Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Julia,\" said Aunt Kate summarily, \"and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'm the man for the ladies,\" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. \"You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"God help me,\" he said, smiling, \"it's the doctor's orders.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, now, Mr. Browne, I'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, you see, I'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: 'Now, Mary Grimes, if I don't take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane's pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quadrilles! Quadrilles!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, here's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,\" said Mary Jane. \"Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that'll just do now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Three ladies, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, Miss Daly, you're really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we're so short of ladies tonight.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't mind in the least, Miss Morkan.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But I've a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor. I'll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Lovely voice, lovely voice!\" said Aunt Kate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the matter, Julia?\" asked Aunt Kate anxiously. \"Who is it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-evening, Freddy,\" said Aunt Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He's not so bad, is he?\" said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel's brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, no, hardly noticeable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, isn't he a terrible fellow!\" she said. \"And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year's Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, then, Teddy, I'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins' attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins' left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress. Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel's eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl. Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes' heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.\n",
    "\n",
    "He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they had taken their places she said abruptly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have a crow to pluck with you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"With me?\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "She nodded her head gravely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is it?\" asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Who is G. C.?\" answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why should I be ashamed of myself?\" asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, I'm ashamed of you,\" said Miss Ivors frankly. \"To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel's face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey's on Bachelor's Walk, to Web's or Massey's on Aston's Quay, or to O'Clohissey's in the bystreet. He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she'd come. She's from Connacht, isn't she?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Her people are,\" said Gabriel shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But you will come, won't you?\" said Miss Ivors, laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The fact is,\" said Gabriel, \"I have just arranged to go----\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Go where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so----\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,\" said Gabriel awkwardly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And why do you go to France and Belgium,\" said Miss Ivors, \"instead of visiting your own land?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with -- Irish?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross- examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And haven't you your own land to visit,\" continued Miss Ivors, \"that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"0, to tell you the truth,\" retorted Gabriel suddenly, \"I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why?\" repeated Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Of course, you've no answer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"West Briton!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit's eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"All right,\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Were you dancing?\" asked Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No row. Why? Did she say so?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He's full of conceit, I think.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There was no row,\" said Gabriel moodily, \"only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn't.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, do go, Gabriel,\" she cried. \"I'd love to see Galway again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can go if you like,\" said Gabriel coldly.\n",
    "\n",
    "She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There's a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table!\n",
    "\n",
    "He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: \"One feels that one is listening to a thought- tormented music.\" Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack.\" Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?\n",
    "\n",
    "A murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia's -- Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer's face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia's face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was just telling my mother,\" he said, \"I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That's the truth. Upon my word and honour that's the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, Browne, if you're serious you might make a worse discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here. And that's the honest truth.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Neither did I,\" said Mr. Browne. \"I think her voice has greatly improved.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thirty years ago I hadn't a bad voice as voices go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I often told Julia,\" said Aunt Kate emphatically, \"that she was simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" continued Aunt Kate, \"she wouldn't be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o'clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, isn't it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?\" asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it's not just, Mary Jane, and it's not right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, Aunt Kate, you're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, I don't question the pope's being right. I'm only a stupid old woman and I wouldn't presume to do such a thing. But there's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia's place I'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his face...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And besides, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane, \"we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,\" added Mr. Browne.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So that we had better go to supper,\" said Mary Jane, \"and finish the discussion afterwards.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But only for ten minutes, Molly,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"That won't delay you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To take a pick itself,\" said Mary Jane, \"after all your dancing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I really couldn't,\" said Miss Ivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am afraid you didn't enjoy yourself at all,\" said Mary Jane hopelessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ever so much, I assure you,\" said Miss Ivors, \"but you really must let me run off now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how can you get home?\" asked Mrs. Conroy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, it's only two steps up the quay.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I'll see you home if you are really obliged to go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But Miss Ivors broke away from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I won't hear of it,\" she cried. \"For goodness' sake go in to your suppers and don't mind me. I'm quite well able to take care of myself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, you're the comical girl, Molly,\" said Mrs. Conroy frankly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Beannacht libh,\" cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where is Gabriel?\" she cried. \"Where on earth is Gabriel? There's everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here I am, Aunt Kate!\" cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, \"ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?\" he asked. \"A wing or a slice of the breast?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Just a small slice of the breast.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Miss Higgins, what for you?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane's idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other's heels, getting in each other's way and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter.\n",
    "\n",
    "When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Very well,\" said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, \"kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily's removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor, a dark- complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Have you heard him?\" he asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Because,\" Freddy Malins explained, \"now I'd be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,\" said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And why couldn't he have a voice too?\" asked Freddy Malins sharply. \"Is it because he's only a black?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin -- Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, well,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, \"I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where are they?\" asked Mr. Browne defiantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In London, Paris, Milan,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly. \"I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Maybe so,\" said Mr. Browne. \"But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, I'd give anything to hear Caruso sing,\" said Mary Jane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For me,\" said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, \"there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Who was he, Miss Morkan?\" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His name,\" said Aunt Kate, \"was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man's throat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Strange,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. \"I never even heard of him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,\" said Mr. Browne. \"I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he's too far back for me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,\" said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia's making and she received praises for it from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,\" said Mr. Browne, \"that I'm brown enough for you because, you know, I'm all brown.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor's care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And do you mean to say,\" asked Mr. Browne incredulously, \"that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.\" said Mary Jane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,\" said Mr. Browne candidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That's the rule of the order,\" said Aunt Kate firmly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, but why?\" asked Mr. Browne.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The coffin,\" said Mary Jane, \"is to remind them of their last end.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair\n",
    "\n",
    "The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door. People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "He began:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, no!\" said Mr. Browne.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the recipients -- or perhaps, I had better say, the victims -- of the hospitality of certain good ladies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid -- and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come -- the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through Gabriel's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hear, hear!\" said Mr. Browne loudly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But yet,\" continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, \"there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of -- what shall I call them? -- the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,\" said Mary Jane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:\n",
    "\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "Which nobody can deny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless he tells a lie,\n",
    "Unless he tells a lie,\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:\n",
    "\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "For they are jolly gay fellows,\n",
    "Which nobody can deny.\n",
    "\n",
    "The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Browne is everywhere,\" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Jane laughed at her tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Really,\" she said archly, \"he is very attentive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He has been laid on here like the gas,\" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, \"all during the Christmas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn't hear me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gretta not down yet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She's getting on her things, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Who's playing up there?\" asked Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nobody. They're all gone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O no, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane. \"Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'd like nothing better this minute,\" said Mr. Browne stoutly, \"than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,\" said Mary Jane, laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?\" asked Mr. Browne.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,\" explained Gabriel, \"commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, now, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, laughing, \"he had a starch mill.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, glue or starch,\" said Gabriel, \"the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman's mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Lord have mercy on his soul,\" said Aunt Kate compassionately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Amen,\" said Gabriel. \"So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel's manner and Aunt Kate said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, now, Gabriel, he didn't live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was there.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Out from the mansion of his forefathers,\" continued Gabriel, \"he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Round and round he went,\" said Gabriel, \"and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. 'Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can't understand the horse!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I could only get one cab,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, we'll find another along the quay,\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" said Aunt Kate. \"Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody's laughter:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Do you know Trinity College?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, sir,\" said the cabman.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,\" said Mr. Browne, \"and then we'll tell you where to go. You understand now?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, sir,\" said the cabman.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Make like a bird for Trinity College.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Right, sir,\" said the cabman.\n",
    "\n",
    "The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man's voice singing.\n",
    "\n",
    "He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, isn't Freddy terrible?\" said Mary Jane. \"He's really terrible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:\n",
    "\n",
    "O, the rain falls on my heavy locks\n",
    "And the dew wets my skin,\n",
    "My babe lies cold...\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O,\" exclaimed Mary Jane. \"It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he wouldn't sing all the night. O, I'll get him to sing a song before he goes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, do, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, what a pity!\" she cried. \"Is he coming down, Gretta?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" cried Mary Jane, \"it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have been at him all the evening,\" said Miss O'Callaghan, \"and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" said Aunt Kate, \"now that was a great fib to tell.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?\" said Mr. D'Arcy roughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's the weather,\" said Aunt Julia, after a pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, everybody has colds,\" said Aunt Kate readily, \"everybody.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"They say,\" said Mary Jane, \"we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I love the look of snow,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So do I,\" said Miss O'Callaghan. \"I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,\" said Aunt Kate, smiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mr. D'Arcy,\" she said, \"what is the name of that song you were singing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's called The Lass of Aughrim,\" said Mr. D'Arcy, \"but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Lass of Aughrim,\" she repeated. \"I couldn't think of the name.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's a very nice air,\" said Mary Jane. \"I'm sorry you were not in voice tonight.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate, \"don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him annoyed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy. Good-night, Miss O'Callaghan.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Miss Morkan.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, all. Safe home.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night. Good night.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is the fire hot, sir?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well. He might have answered rudely.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all their souls' tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her then he had said: \"Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gretta!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at him....\n",
    "\n",
    "At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I see a white man this time,\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where?\" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Dan,\" he said gaily.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy's protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A prosperous New Year to you, sir.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The same to you,\" said Gabriel cordially.\n",
    "\n",
    "She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good- night. She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Eight,\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,\" he added, pointing to the candle, \"you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gretta! \"\n",
    "\n",
    "She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You looked tired,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am a little,\" she answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You don't feel ill or weak?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, tired: that's all.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"By the way, Gretta!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You know that poor fellow Malins?\" he said quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes. What about him?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, poor fellow, he's a decent sort of chap, after all,\" continued Gabriel in a false voice. \"He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he's not a bad fellow, really.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When did you lend him the pound?\" she asked, after a pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are a very generous person, Gabriel,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.\n",
    "\n",
    "He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What about the song? Why does that make you cry?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why, Gretta?\" he asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And who was the person long ago?\" asked Gabriel, smiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smile passed away from Gabriel's face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Someone you were in love with?\" he asked ironically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was a young boy I used to know,\" she answered, \"named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He was very delicate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I can see him so plainly,\" she said, after a moment. \"Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them -- an expression!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"O, then, you are in love with him?\" said Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I used to go out walking with him,\" she said, \"when I was in Galway.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A thought flew across Gabriel's mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\" he said coldly.\n",
    "\n",
    "She looked at him and asked in surprise:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What for?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How do I know? To see him, perhaps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He is dead,\" she said at length. \"He died when he was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What was he?\" asked Gabriel, still ironically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He was in the gasworks,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.\n",
    "\n",
    "He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was great with him at that time,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I think he died for me,\" she answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was in the winter,\" she said, \"about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She paused for a moment and sighed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Poor fellow,\" she said. \"He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well; and then?\" asked Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother's house in Nuns' Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn't see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And did you not tell him to go back?\" asked Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And did he go home?\" asked Gabriel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She was fast asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt's supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\n",

    "          I used to go to thrift stores with my friends. Wed take the train into Boston, and go to The Garment District, which is this huge vintage clothing warehouse. Everything is arranged by color, and somehow that makes all of the clothes beautiful. Its kind of like if you went through the wardrobe in the Narnia books, only instead of finding Aslan and the White Witch and horrible Eustace, you found this magic clothing worldinstead of talking animals, there were feather boas and wedding dresses and bowling shoes, and paisley shirts and Doc Martens and everything hung up on racks so that first you have black dresses, all together, like the worlds largest indoor funeral, and then blue dressesall the blues you can imagineand then red dresses and so on. Pink-reds and orangey reds and purple-reds and exit-light reds and candy reds. Sometimes I would close my eyes and Natasha and Natalie and Jake would drag me over to a rack, and rub a dress against my hand. Guess what color this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We had this theory that you could learn how to tell, just by feeling, what color something was. For example, if youre sitting on a lawn, you can tell what color green the grass is, with your eyes closed, depending on how silky-rubbery it feels. With clothing, stretchy velvet stuff always feels red when your eyes are closed, even if its not red. Natasha was always best at guessing colors, but Natasha is also best at cheating at games and not getting caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "One time we were looking through kids t-shirts and we found a Muppets t-shirt that had belonged to Natalie in third grade. We knew it belonged to her, because it still had her name inside, where her mother had written it in permanent marker, when Natalie went to summer camp. Jake bought it back for her, because he was the only one who had money that weekend. He was the only one who had a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe youre wondering what a guy like Jake is doing in The Garment District with a bunch of girls. The thing about Jake is that he always has a good time, no matter what hes doing. He likes everything, and he likes everyone, but he likes me best of all. Wherever he is now, I bet hes having a great time and wondering when Im going to show up. Im always running late. But he knows that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had this theory that things have life cycles, the way that people do. The life cycle of wedding dresses and feather boas and t-shirts and shoes and handbags involves the Garment District. If clothes are good, or even if theyre bad in an interesting way, the Garment District is where they go when they die. You can tell that theyre dead, because of the way that they smell. When you buy them, and wash them, and start wearing them again, and they start to smell like you, thats when they reincarnate. But the point is, if youre looking for a particular thing, you just have to keep looking for it. You have to look hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Down in the basement at the Garment Factory they sell clothing and beat-up suitcases and teacups by the pound. You can get eight pounds worth of prom dressesa slinky black dress, a poufy lavender dress, a swirly pink dress, a silvery, starry lame dress so fine you could pass it through a key ring for eight dollars. I go there every week, hunting for Grandmother Zofias faery handbag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The faery handbag: Its huge and black and kind of hairy. Even when your eyes are closed, it feels black. As black as black ever gets, like if you touch it, your hand might get stuck in it, like tar or black quicksand or when you stretch out your hand at night, to turn on a light, but all you feel is darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairies live inside it. I know what that sounds like, but its true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grandmother Zofia said it was a family heirloom. She said that it was over two hundred years old. She said that when she died, I had to look after it. Be its guardian. She said that it would be my responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "I said that it didnt look that old, and that they didnt have handbag two hundred years ago, but that just made her cross. She said, So then tell me, Genevieve, darling, where do you think old ladies used to put their reading glasses and their heart medicine and their knitting needles?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that no one is going to believe any of this. Thats okay. If I thought you would, then I couldnt tell you. Promise me that you wont believe a word. Thats what Zofia used to say to me when she told me stories. At the funeral, my mother said, half-laughing and half-crying, that her mother was the worlds best liar. I think she thought maybe Zofia wasnt really dead. But I went up to Zofias coffin, and I looked her right in the eyes. They were closed. The funeral parlor had made her up with blue eyeshadow, and blue eyeliner. She looked like she was going to be a news anchor on Fox television, instead of dead. It was creepy and it made me even sadder than I already was. But I didnt let that distract me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, Zofia, I whispered. I know youre dead, but this is important. You know exactly how important this is. Wheres the handbag? What did you do with it? How do I find it? What am I supposed to do now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course she didnt say a word. She just lay there, this little smile on her face, as if she thought the whole thingdeath, blue eyeshadow, Jake, the handbag, faeries, Scrabble, Baldeziwurlekistan, all of itwas a joke. She always did have a weird sense of humor. Thats why she and Jake got along so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I grew up in a house next door to the house where my mother lived when she was a little girl. Her mother, Zofia Swink, my grandmother, babysat me while my mother and father were at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia never looked like a grandmother. She had long black hair which she wore up in little, braided, spiky towers and plaits. She had large blue eyes. She was taller than my father. She looked like a spy or ballerina or a lady pirate or a rock star. She acted like one too. For example, she never drove anywhere. She rode a bike. It drove my mother crazy. Why cant you act your age? shed say, and Zofia would just laugh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia and I played Scrabble all the time. Zofia always won, even though her English wasnt all that great, because wed decided that she was allowed to use Baldeziwurleki vocabulary. Baldeziwurlekistan is where Zofia was born, over two hundred years ago. Thats what Zofia said. (My grandmother claimed to be over two hundred years old. Or maybe even older. Sometimes she claimed that shed even met Ghenghis Khan. He was much shorter than her. I probably dont have time to tell that story.) Baldeziwurlekistan is also an incredibly valuable word in Scrabble points, even though it doesnt exactly fit on the board. Zofia put it down the first time we played. I was feeling pretty good because Id gotten forty-one points for zippery on my turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia kept rearranging her letters on her tray. Then she looked over at me, as if daring me to stop her, and put down eziwurlekistan, after bald. She used delicious, zippery, wishes, kismet, and needle, and made to into toe. Baldeziwurlekistan went all the way across the board and then trailed off down the righthand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used up all my letters, Zofia said. She licked her pencil and started adding up points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats not a word, I said. Baldeziwurlekistan is not a word. Besides, you cant do that. You cant put an eighteen letter word on a board thats fifteen squares across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not? Its a country, Zofia said. Its where I was born, little darling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge, I said. I went and got the dictionary and looked it up. Theres no such place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there isnt nowadays, Zofia said. It wasnt a very big place, even when it was a place. But youve heard of Samarkand, and Uzbekistan and the Silk Road and Ghenghis Khan. Havent I told you about meeting Ghenghis Khan?\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked up Samarkand. Okay, I said. Samarkand is a real place. A real word. But Baldeziwurlekistan isnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "They call it something else now, Zofia said. But I think its important to remember where we come from. I think its only fair that I get to use Baldeziwurleki words. Your English is so much better than me. Promise me something, mouthful of dumpling, a small, small thing. Youll remember its real name. Baldeziwurlekistan. Now when I add it up, I get three hundred and sixty-eight points. Could that be right?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you called the faery handbag by its right name, it would be something like orzipanikanikcz, which means the bag of skin where the world lives, only Zofia never spelled that word the same way twice. She said you had to spell it a little differently each time. You never wanted to spell it exactly the right way, because that would be dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "I called it the faery handbag because I put faery down on the Scrabble board once. Zofia said that you spelled it with an i, not an e. She looked it up in the dictionary, and lost a turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia said that in Baldeziwurlekistan they used a board and tiles for divination, prognostication, and sometimes even just for fun. She said it was a little like playing Scrabble. Thats probably why she turned out to be so good at Scrabble. The Baldeziwurlekistanians used their tiles and board to communicate with the people who lived under the hill. The people who lived under the hill knew the future. The Baldeziwurlekistanians gave them fermented milk and honey, and the young women of the village used to go and lie out on the hill and sleep under the stars. Apparently the people under the hill were pretty cute. The important thing was that you never went down into the hill and spent the night there, no matter how cute the guy from under the hill was. If you did, even if you only spent a single night under the hill, when you came out again a hundred years might have passed. Remember that, Zofia said to me. It doesnt matter how cute a guy is. If he wants you to come back to his place, it isnt a good idea. Its okay to fool around, but dont spend the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every once in a while, a woman from under the hill would marry a man from the village, even though it never ended well. The problem was that the women under the hill were terrible cooks. They couldnt get used to the way time worked in the village, which meant that supper always got burnt, or else it wasnt cooked long enough. But they couldnt stand to be criticized. It hurt their feelings. If their village husband complained, or even if he looked like he wanted to complain, that was it. The woman from under the hill went back to her home, and even if her husband went and begged and pleaded and apologized, it might be three years or thirty years or a few generations before she came back out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best, happiest marriages between the Baldeziwurlekistanians and the people under the hill fell apart when the children got old enough to complain about dinner. But everyone in the village had some hill blood in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its in you, Zofia said, and kissed me on the nose. Passed down from my grandmother and her mother. Its why were so beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Zofia was nineteen, the shaman-priestess in her village threw the tiles and discovered that something bad was going to happen. A raiding party was coming. There was no point in fighting them. They would burn down everyones houses and take the young men and women for slaves. And it was even worse than that. There was going to be an earthquake as well, which was bad news because usually, when raiders showed up, the village went down under the hill for a night and when they came out again the raiders would have been gone for months or decades or even a hundred years. But this earthquake was going to split the hill right open.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people under the hill were in trouble. Their home would be destroyed, and they would be doomed to roam the face of the earth, weeping and lamenting their fate until the sun blew out and the sky cracked and the seas boiled and the people dried up and turned to dust and blew away. So the shaman-priestess went and divined some more, and the people under the hill told her to kill a black dog and skin it and use the skin to make a purse big enough to hold a chicken, an egg, and a cooking pot. So she did, and then the people under the hill made the inside of the purse big enough to hold all of the village and all of the people under the hill and mountains and forests and seas and rivers and lakes and orchards and a sky and stars and spirits and fabulous monsters and sirens and dragons and dryads and mermaids and beasties and all the little gods that the Baldeziwurlekistanians and the people under the hill worshipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your purse is made out of dog skin? I said. Thats disgusting!\n",
    "\n",
    "Little dear pet, Zofia said, looking wistful, Dog is delicious. To Baldeziwurlekistanians, dog is a delicacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the raiding party arrived, the village packed up all of their belongings and moved into the handbag. The clasp was made out of bone. If you opened it one way, then it was just a purse big enough to hold a chicken and an egg and a clay cooking pot, or else a pair of reading glasses and a library book and a pillbox. If you opened the clasp another way, then you found yourself in a little boat floating at the mouth of a river. On either side of you was forest, where the Baldeziwurlekistanian villagers and the people under the hill made their new settlement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you opened the handbag the wrong way, though, you found yourself in a dark land that smelled like blood. Thats where the guardian of the purse (the dog whose skin had been been sewn into a purse) lived. The guardian had no skin. Its howl made blood come out of your ears and nose. It tore apart anyone who turned the clasp in the opposite direction and opened the purse in the wrong way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the wrong way to open the handbag, Zofia said. She twisted the clasp, showing me how she did it. She opened the mouth of the purse, but not very wide and held it up to me. Go ahead, darling, and listen for a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "I put my head near the handbag, but not too near. I didnt hear anything. I dont hear anything, I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor dog is probably asleep, Zofia said. Even nightmares have to sleep now and then.\n",
    "\n",
    "After he got expelled, everybody at school called Jake Houdini instead of Jake. Everybody except for me. Ill explain why, but you have to be patient. Its hard work telling everything in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake is smarter and also taller than most of our teachers. Not quite as tall as me. Weve known each other since third grade. Jake has always been in love with me. He says he was in love with me even before third grade, even before we ever met. It took me a while to fall in love with Jake.\n",
    "\n",
    "In third grade, Jake knew everything already, except how to make friends. He used to follow me around all day long. It made me so mad that I kicked him in the knee. When that didnt work, I threw his backpack out of the window of the school bus. That didnt work either, but the next year Jake took some tests and the school decided that he could skip fourth and fifth grade. Even I felt sorry for Jake then. Sixth grade didnt work out. When the sixth graders wouldnt stop flushing his head down the toilet, he went out and caught a skunk and set it loose in the boys locker room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The school was going to suspend him for the rest of the year, but instead Jake took two years off while his mother home-schooled him. He learned Latin and Hebrew and Greek, how to write sestinas, how to make sushi, how to play bridge, and even how to knit. He learned fencing and ballroom dancing. He worked in a soup kitchen and made a Super Eight movie about Civil War reenactors who play extreme croquet in full costume instead of firing off cannons. He started learning how to play guitar. He even wrote a novel. Ive never read ithe says it was awful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he came back two years later, because his mother had cancer for the first time, the school put him back with our year, in seventh grade. He was still way too smart, but he was finally smart enough to figure out how to fit in. Plus he was good at soccer and he was really cute. Did I mention that he played guitar? Every girl in school had a crush on Jake, but he used to come home after school with me and play Scrabble with Zofia and ask her about Baldeziwurlekistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jakes mom was named Cynthia. She collected ceramic frogs and knock-knock jokes. When we were in ninth grade, she had cancer again. When she died, Jake smashed all of her frogs. That was the first funeral I ever went to. A few months later, Jakes father asked Jakes fencing teacher out on a date. They got married right after the school expelled Jake for his AP project on Houdini. That was the first wedding I ever went to. Jake and I stole a bottle of wine and drank it, and I threw up in the swimming pool at the country club. Jake threw up all over my shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, anyway, the village and the people under the hill lived happily every after for a few weeks in the handbag, which they had tied around a rock in a dry well which the people under the hill had determined would survive the earthquake. But some of the Baldeziwurlekistanians wanted to come out again and see what was going on in the world. Zofia was one of them. It had been summer when they went into the bag, but when they came out again, and climbed out of the well, snow was falling and their village was ruins and crumbly old rubble. They walked through the snow, Zofia carrying the handbag, until they came to another village, one that theyd never seen before. Everyone in that village was packing up their belongings and leaving, which gave Zofia and her friends a bad feeling. It seemed to be just the same as when they went into the handbag.\n",
    "\n",
    "They followed the refugees, who seemed to know where they were going, and finally everyone came to a city. Zofia had ever seen such a place. There were trains and electric lights and movie theaters, and there were people shooting each other. Bombs were falling. A war going on. Most of the villagers decided to climb right back inside the handbag, but Zofia volunteered to stay in the world and look after the handbag. She had fallen in love with movies and silk stockings and with a young man, a Russian deserter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia and the Russian deserter married and had many adventures and finally came to America, where my mother was born. Now and then Zofia would consult the tiles and talk to the people who lived in the handbag and they would tell her how best to avoid trouble and how she and her husband could make some money. Every now and then one of the Baldeziwurlekistanians, or one of the people from under the hill came out of the handbag and wanted to go grocery shopping, or to a movie or an amusement park to ride on roller coasters, or to the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more advice Zofia gave her husband, the more money they made. Her husband became curious about Zofias handbag, because he could see that there was something odd about it, but Zofia told him to mind his own business. He began to spy on Zofia, and saw that strange men and women were coming in and out of the house. He became convinced that either Zofia was a spy for the Communists, or maybe that she was having affairs. They fought and he drank more and more, and finally he threw away her divination tiles. Russians make bad husbands, Zofia told me. Finally, one night while Zofia was sleeping, her husband opened the bone clasp and climbed inside the handbag.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought hed left me, Zofia said. For almost twenty years I thought hed left me and your mother and taken off for California. Not that I minded. I was tired of being married and cooking dinners and cleaning house for someone else. Its better to cook what I want to eat, and clean up when I decide to clean up. It was harder on your mother, not having a father. That was the part that I minded most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it turned out that he hadnt run away after all. Hed spent one night in the handbag and then come out again twenty years later, exactly as handsome as I remembered, and enough time had passed that I had forgiven him all the quarrels. We made up and it was all very romantic and then when we had another fight the next morning, he went and kissed your mother, who had slept right through his visit, on the cheek, and then he climbed right back inside the handbag. I didnt see him again for another twenty years. The last time he showed up, we went to see Star Wars and he liked it so much that he went back inside the handbag to tell everyone else about it. In a couple of years theyll all show up and want to see it on video and all of the sequels too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell them not to bother with the prequels, I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about Zofia and libraries is that shes always losing library books. She says that she hasnt lost them, and in fact that they arent even overdue, really. Its just that even one week inside the faery handbag is a lot longer in library-world time. So what is she supposed to do about it? The librarians all hate Zofia. Shes banned from using any of the branches in our area. When I was eight, she got me to go to the library for her and check out a bunch of biographies and science books and some Georgette Heyer romance novels. My mother was livid when she found out, but it was too late. Zofia had already misplaced most of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its really hard to write about somebody as if theyre really dead. I still think Zofia must be sitting in her living room, in her house, watching some old horror movie, dropping popcorn into her handbag. Shes waiting for me to come over and play Scrabble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody is ever going to return those library books now.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mother used to come home from work and roll her eyes. Have you been telling them your fairy stories? shed say. Genevieve, your grandmother is a horrible liar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia would fold up the Scrabble board and shrug at me and Jake. Im a wonderful liar, shed say. Im the best liar in the world. Promise me you wont believe a single word.\n",
    "\n",
    "But she wouldnt tell the story of the faery handbag to Jake. Only the old Baldeziwurlekistanian folktales and fairytales about the people under the hill. She told him about how she and her husband made it all the way across Europe, hiding in haystacks and in barns, and how once, when her husband went off to find food, a farmer found her hiding in his chicken coop and tried to rape her. But she opened up the faery handbag in the way she showed me, and the dog came out and ate the farmer and all his chickens too.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was teaching Jake and me how to curse in Baldeziwurleki. I also know how to say I love you, but Im not going to ever say it to anyone again, except to Jake, when I find him.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was eight, I believed everything Zofia told me. By the time I was thirteen, I didnt believe a single word. When I was fifteen, I saw a man come out of her house and get on Zofias three-speed bicycle and ride down the street. His clothes looked funny. He was a lot younger than my mother and father, and even though Id never seen him before, he was familiar. I followed him on my bike, all the way to the grocery store. I waited just past the checkout lanes while he bought peanut butter, Jack Daniels, half a dozen instant cameras, and at least sixty packs of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, three bags of Hersheys kisses, a handful of Milky Way bars and other stuff from the rack of checkout candy. While the checkout clerk was helping him bag up all of that chocolate, he looked up and saw me. Genevieve? he said. Thats your name, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I turned and ran out of the store. He grabbed up the bags and ran after me. I dont even think he got his change back. I was still running away, and then one of the straps on my flip flops popped out of the sole, the way they do, and that made me really angry so I just stopped. I turned around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are you? I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I already knew. He looked like he could have been my moms younger brother. He was really cute. I could see why Zofia had fallen in love with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "His name was Rustan. Zofia told my parents that he was an expert in Baldeziwurlekistanian folklore who would be staying with her for a few days. She brought him over for dinner. Jake was there too, and I could tell that Jake knew something was up. Everybody except my dad knew something was going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You mean Baldeziwurlekistan is a real place? my mother asked Rustan. My mother is telling the truth?\n",
    "\n",
    "I could see that Rustan was having a hard time with that one. He obviously wanted to say that his wife was a horrible liar, but then where would he be? Then he couldnt be the person that he was supposed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were probably a lot of things that he wanted to say. What he said was, This is really good pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rustan took a lot of pictures at dinner. The next day I went with him to get the pictures developed. Hed brought back some film with him, with pictures hed taken inside the faery handbag, but those didnt come out well. Maybe the film was too old. We got doubles of the pictures from dinner so that I could have some too. Theres a great picture of Jake, sitting outside on the porch. Hes laughing, and he has his hand up to his mouth, like hes going to catch the laugh. I have that picture up on my computer, and also up on my wall over my bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bought a Cadbury Cream Egg for Rustan. Then we shook hands and he kissed me once on each cheek. Give one of those kisses to your mother, he said, and I thought about how the next time I saw him, I might be Zofias age, and he would only be a few days older. The next time I saw him, Zofia would be dead. Jake and I might have kids. That was too weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know Rustan tried to get Zofia to go with him, to live in the handbag, but she wouldnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes me dizzy in there, she used to tell me. And they dont have movie theaters. And I have to look after your mother and you. Maybe when youre old enough to look after the handbag, Ill poke my head inside, just long enough for a little visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt fall in love with Jake because he was smart. Im pretty smart myself. I know that smart doesnt mean nice, or even mean that you have a lot of common sense. Look at all the trouble smart people get themselves into.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt fall in love with Jake because he could make maki rolls and had a black belt in fencing, or whatever it is that you get if youre good in fencing. I didnt fall in love with Jake because he plays guitar. Hes a better soccer player than he is a guitar player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those were the reasons why I went out on a date with Jake. That, and because he asked me. He asked if I wanted to go see a movie, and I asked if I could bring my grandmother and Natalie and Natasha. He said sure and so all five of us sat and watched Bring It On and every once in a while Zofia dropped a couple of milk duds or some popcorn into her purse. I dont know if she was feeding the dog, or if shed opened the purse the right way, and was throwing food at her husband.\n",
    "\n",
    "I fell in love with Jake because he told stupid knock-knock jokes to Natalie, and told Natasha that he liked her jeans. I fell in love with Jake when he took me and Zofia home. He walked her up to her front door and then he walked me up to mine. I fell in love with Jake when he didnt try to kiss me. The thing is, I was nervous about the whole kissing thing. Most guys think that theyre better at it than they really are. Not that I think Im a real genius at kissing either, but I dont think kissing should be a competitive sport. It isnt tennis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natalie and Natasha and I used to practice kissing with each other. Not that we like each other that way, but just for practice. We got pretty good at it. We could see why kissing was supposed to be fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Jake didnt try to kiss me. Instead he just gave me this really big hug. He put his face in my hair and he sighed. We stood there like that, and then finally I said, What are you doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "I just wanted to smell your hair, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, I said. That made me feel weird, but in a good way. I put my nose up to his hair, which is brown and curly, and I smelled it. We stood there and smelled each others hair, and I felt so good. I felt so happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake said into my hair, Do you know that actor John Cusack?\n",
    "\n",
    "I said, Yeah. One of Zofias favorite movies is Better Off Dead. We watch it all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he likes to go up to women and smell their armpits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross! I said. Thats such a lie! What are you doing now? That tickles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im smelling your ear, Jake said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jakes hair smelled like iced tea with honey in it, after all the ice has melted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kissing Jake is like kissing Natalie or Natasha, except that it isnt just for fun. It feels like something there isnt a word for in Scrabble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal with Houdini is that Jake got interested in him during Advanced Placement American History. He and I were both put in tenth grade history. We were doing biography projects. I was studying Joseph McCarthy. My grandmother had all sorts of stories about McCarthy. She hated him for what he did to Hollywood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake didnt turn in his projectinstead he told everyone in our AP class except for Mr. Streep (we call him Meryl) to meet him at the gym on Saturday. When we showed up, Jake reenacted one of Houdinis escapes with a laundry bag, handcuffs, a gym locker, bicycle chains, and the schools swimming pool. It took him three and a half minutes to get free, and this guy named Roger took a bunch of photos and then put the photos online. One of the photos ended up in the Boston Globe, and Jake got expelled. The really ironic thing was that while his mom was in the hospital, Jake had applied to M.I.T. He did it for his mom. He thought that way shed have to stay alive. She was so excited about M.I.T. A couple of days after hed been expelled, right after the wedding, while his dad and the fencing instructor were in Bermuda, he got an acceptance letter in the mail and a phone call from this guy in the admissions office who explained why they had to withdraw the acceptance.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mother wanted to know why I let Jake wrap himself up in bicycle chains and then watched while Peter and Michael pushed him into the deep end of the school pool. I said that Jake had a backup plan. Ten more seconds and we were all going to jump into the pool and open the locker and get him out of there. I was crying when I said that. Even before he got in the locker, I knew how stupid Jake was being. Afterwards, he promised me that hed never do anything like that again.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was when I told him about Zofias husband, Rustan, and about Zofias handbag. How stupid am I?\n",
    "\n",
    "So I guess you can figure out what happened next. The problem is that Jake believed me about the handbag. We spent a lot of time over at Zofias, playing Scrabble. Zofia never let the faery handbag out of her sight. She even took it with her when she went to the bathroom. I think she even slept with it under her pillow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt tell her that Id said anything to Jake. I wouldnt ever have told anybody else about it. Not Natasha. Not even Natalie, who is the most responsible person in all of the world. Now, of course, if the handbag turns up and Jake still hasnt come back, Ill have to tell Natalie. Somebody has to keep an eye on the stupid thing while I go find Jake.\n",
    "\n",
    "What worries me is that maybe one of the Baldeziwurlekistanians or one of the people under the hill or maybe even Rustan popped out of the handbag to run an errand and got worried when Zofia wasnt there. Maybe theyll come looking for her and bring it back. Maybe they know Im supposed to look after it now. Or maybe they took it and hid it somewhere. Maybe someone turned it in at the lost-and-found at the library and that stupid librarian called the F.B.I. Maybe scientists at the Pentagon are examining the handbag right now. Testing it. If Jake comes out, theyll think hes a spy or a superweapon or an alien or something. Theyre not going to just let him go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone thinks Jake ran away, except for my mother, who is convinced that he was trying out another Houdini escape and is probably lying at the bottom of a lake somewhere. She hasnt said that to me, but I can see her thinking it. She keeps making cookies for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened is that Jake said, Can I see that for just a second?\n",
    "\n",
    "He said it so casually that I think he caught Zofia off guard. She was reaching into the purse for her wallet. We were standing in the lobby of the movie theater on a Monday morning. Jake was behind the snack counter. Hed gotten a job there. He was wearing this stupid red paper hat and some kind of apron-bib thing. He was supposed to ask us if we wanted to supersize our drinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "He reached over the counter and took Zofias handbag right out of her hand. He closed it and then he opened it again. I think he opened it the right way. I dont think he ended up in the dark place. He said to me and Zofia, Ill be right back. And then he wasnt there anymore. It was just me and Zofia and the handbag, lying there on the counter where hed dropped it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Id been fast enough, I think I could have followed him. But Zofia had been guardian of the faery handbag for a lot longer. She snatched the bag back and glared at me. Hes a very bad boy, she said. She was absolutely furious. Youre better off without him, Genevieve, I think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me the handbag, I said. I have to go get him.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isnt a toy, Genevieve, she said. It isnt a game. This isnt Scrabble. He comes back when he comes back. If he comes back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me the handbag, I said. Or Ill take it from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "She held the handbag up high over her head, so that I couldnt reach it. I hate people who are taller than me. What are you going to do now, Zofia said. Are you going to knock me down? Are you going to steal the handbag? Are you going to go away and leave me here to explain to your parents where youve gone? Are you going to say goodbye to your friends? When you come out again, they will have gone to college. Theyll have jobs and babies and houses and they wont even recognize you. Your mother will be an old woman and I will be dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont care, I said. I sat down on the sticky red carpet in the lobby and started to cry. Someone wearing a little metal name tag came over and asked if we were okay. His name was Missy. Or maybe he was wearing someone elses tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Were fine, Zofia said. My granddaughter has the flu.\n",
    "\n",
    "She took my hand and pulled me up. She put her arm around me and we walked out of the theater. We never even got to see the stupid movie. We never even got to see another movie together. I dont ever want to go see another movie. The problem is, I dont want to see unhappy endings. And I dont know if I believe in the happy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a plan, Zofia said. I will go find Jake. You will stay here and look after the handbag.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wont come back either, I said. I cried even harder. Or if you do, Ill be like a hundred years old and Jake will still be sixteen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything will be okay, Zofia said. I wish I could tell you how beautiful she looked right then. It didnt matter if she was lying or if she actually knew that everything was going to be okay. The important thing was how she looked when she said it. She said, with absolute certainty, or maybe with all the skill of a very skillful liar, My plan will work. First we go to the library, though. One of the people under the hill just brought back an Agatha Christie mystery, and I need to return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Were going to the library? I said. Why dont we just go home and play Scrabble for a while. You probably think I was just being sarcastic here, and I was being sarcastic. But Zofia gave me a sharp look. She knew that if I was being sarcastic that my brain was working again. She knew that I knew she was stalling for time. She knew that I was coming up with my own plan, which was a lot like Zofias plan, except that I was the one who went into the handbag. How was the part I was working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do that, she said. Remember, when you dont know what to do, it never hurts to play Scrabble. Its like reading the I Ching or tea leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we please just hurry? I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zofia just looked at me. Genevieve, we have plenty of time. If youre going to look after the handbag, you have to remember that. You have to be patient. Can you be patient?\n",
    "\n",
    "I can try, I told her. Im trying, Zofia. Im trying really hard. But it isnt fair. Jake is off having adventures and talking to talking animals, and who knows, learning how to fly and some beautiful three thousand year old girl from under the hill is teaching him how to speak fluent Baldeziwurleki. I bet she lives in a house that runs around on chicken legs, and she tells Jake that shed love to hear him play something on the guitar. Maybe youll kiss her, Jake, because shes put a spell on you. But whatever you do, dont go up into her house. Dont fall asleep in her bed. Come back soon, Jake, and bring the handbag with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hate those movies, those books, where some guy gets to go off and have adventures and meanwhile the girl has to stay home and wait. Im a feminist. I subscribe to Bust magazine, and I watch Buffy reruns. I dont believe in that kind of shit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hadnt been in the library for five minutes before Zofia picked up a biography of Carl Sagan and dropped it in her purse. She was definitely stalling for time. She was trying to come up with a plan that would counteract the plan that she knew I was planning. I wondered what she thought I was planning. It was probably much better than anything Id come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont do that! I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont worry, Zofia said. Nobody was watching.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont care if nobody saw! What if Jakes sitting there in the boat, or what if he was coming back and you just dropped it on his head!\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesnt work that way, Zofia said. Then she said, It would serve him right, anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was when the librarian came up to us. She had a nametag on as well. I was so sick of people and their stupid nametags. Im not even going to tell you what her name was. I saw that, the librarian said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saw what? Zofia said. She smiled down at the librarian, like she was Queen of the Library, and the librarian were a petitioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The librarian stared hard at her. I know you, she said, almost sounding awed, like she was a weekend birdwatcher who just seen Bigfoot. We have your picture on the office wall. Youre Ms. Swinks. You arent allowed to check out books here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats ridiculous, Zofia said. She was at least two feet taller than the librarian. I felt a bit sorry for the librarian. After all, Zofia had just stolen a seven-day book. She probably wouldnt return it for a hundred years. My mother has always made it clear that its my job to protect other people from Zofia. I guess I was Zofias guardian before I became the guardian of the handbag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The librarian reached up and grabbed Zofias handbag. She was small but she was strong. She jerked the handbag and Zofia stumbled and fell back against a work desk. I couldnt believe it. Everyone except for me was getting a look at Zofias handbag. What kind of guardian was I going to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Genevieve, Zofia said. She held my hand very tightly, and I looked at her. She looked wobbly and pale. She said, I feel very bad about all of this. Tell your mother I said so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then she said one last thing, but I think it was in Baldeziwurleki.\n",
    "\n",
    "The librarian said, I saw you put a book in here. Right here. She opened the handbag and peered inside. Out of the handbag came a long, lonely, ferocious, utterly hopeless scream of rage. I dont ever want to hear that noise again. Everyone in the library looked up. The librarian made a choking noise and threw Zofias handbag away from her. A little trickle of blood came out of her nose and a drop fell on the floor. What I thought at first was that it was just plain luck that the handbag was closed when it landed. Later on I was trying to figure out what Zofia said. My Baldeziwurleki isnt very good, but I think she was saying something like Figures. Stupid librarian. I have to go take care of that damn dog. So maybe thats what happened. Maybe Zofia sent part of herself in there with the skinless dog. Maybe she fought it and won and closed the handbag. Maybe she made friends with it. I mean, she used to feed it popcorn at the movies. Maybe shes still in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened in the library was Zofia sighed a little and closed her eyes. I helped her sit down in a chair, but I dont think she was really there any more. I rode with her in the ambulance, when the ambulance finally showed up, and I swear I didnt even think about the handbag until my mother showed up. I didnt say a word. I just left her there in the hospital with Zofia, who was on a respirator, and I ran all the way back to the library. But it was closed. So I ran all the way back again, to the hospital, but you already know what happened, right? Zofia died. I hate writing that. My tall, funny, beautiful, book-stealing, Scrabble-playing, story-telling grandmother died.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you never met her. Youre probably wondering about the handbag. What happened to it. I put up signs all over town, like Zofias handbag was some kind of lost dog, but nobody ever called.\n",
    "\n",
    "So thats the story so far. Not that I expect you to believe any of it. Last night Natalie and Natasha came over and we played Scrabble. They dont really like Scrabble, but they feel like its their job to cheer me up. I won. After they went home, I flipped all the tiles upside-down and then I started picking them up in groups of seven. I tried to ask a question, but it was hard to pick just one. The words I got werent so great either, so I decided that they werent English words. They were Baldeziwurleki words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I decided that, everything became perfectly clear. First I put down kirif which means happy news, and then I got a b, an o, an l, an e, a f, another i, an s, and a z. So then I could make kirif into bolekirifisz, which could mean the happy result of a combination of diligent effort and patience.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would find the faery handbag. The tiles said so. I would work the clasp and go into the handbag and have my own adventures and would rescue Jake. Hardly any time would have gone by before we came back out of the handbag. Maybe Id even make friends with that poor dog and get to say goodbye, for real, to Zofia. Rustan would show up again and be really sorry that hed missed Zofias funeral and this time he would be brave enough to tell my mother the whole story. He would tell her that he was her father. Not that she would believe him. Not that you should believe this story. Promise me that you wont believe a word.\n",
    "          ''',\n",
    "          \n",
    "         '''\n",
    "         It was the hunter's first time outside Montana. He woke, stricken still with the hours-old vision of ascending through rose-lit cumulus, of houses and barns like specks deep in the snowed-in valleys, all the scrolling country below looking Decemberbrown and black hills streaked with snow, flashes of iced-over lakes, the long braids of a river gleaming at the bottom of a canyon. Above the wing the sky had deepened to a blue so pure he knew it would bring tears to his eyes if he looked long enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it was dark. The airplane descended over Chicago, its galaxy of electric lights, the vast neighborhoods coming clearer as the plane glided toward the airportstreetlights, headlights, stacks of buildings, ice rinks, a truck turning at a stoplight, scraps of snow atop a warehouse and winking antennae on faraway hills, finally the long converging parallels of blue runway lights, and they were down.\n",
    "\n",
    "He walked into the airport, past the banks of monitors. Already he felt as if he'd lost something, some beautiful perspective, some lovely dream fallen away. He had come to Chicago to see his wife, whom he had not seen in twenty years. She was there to perform her magic for a higher-up at the state university. Even universities, apparently, were interested in what she could do. Outside the terminal the sky was thick and gray and hurried by wind. Snow was coming. A woman from the university met him and escorted him to her Jeep. He kept his gaze out the window.\n",

    "They were in the car for forty-five minutes, passing first the tall, lighted architecture of downtown, then naked suburban oaks, heaps of ploughed snow, gas stations, power towers, and telephone wires. The woman said, \"So you regularly attend your wife's performances?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" he said. \"Never before.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She parked in the driveway of an elaborate modern mansion, with square balconies suspended over two garages, huge triangular windows in the façade, sleek columns, domed lights, a steep shale roof.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the front door about thirty nametags were laid out on a table. His wife was not there yet. No one, apparently, was there yet. He found his tag and pinned it to his sweater. A silent girl in a tuxedo appeared and disappeared with his coat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The granite foyer was backed with a grand staircase, which spread wide at the bottom and tapered at the top. A woman came down. She stopped four or five steps from the bottom and said, \"Hello, Anne\" to the woman who had driven him there and \"You must be Mr. Dumas\" to him. He took her hand, a pale, bony thing, weightless, like a featherless bird.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her husband, the university's chancellor, was just knotting his bow tie, she said, and she laughed sadly to herself, as if bow ties were something she disapproved of. The hunter moved to a window, shifted aside the curtain, and peered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the poor light he could see a wooden deck the length of the house, angled and stepped, its width ever changing, with a low rail. Beyond it, in the blue shadows, a small pond lay encircled by hedges, with a marble birdbath at its center. Behind the pond stood leafless treesoaks, maples, a sycamore as white as bone. A helicopter shuttled past, its green light winking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's snowing,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is it?\" the hostess asked, with an air of concern, perhaps false. It was impossible to tell what was sincere and what was not. The woman who had driven him there had moved to the bar, where she cradled a drink and stared into the carpet.\n",
    "\n",
    "He let the curtain fall back. The chancellor came down the staircase. Other guests fluttered in. A man in gray corduroy, with \"Bruce Maples\" on his nametag, approached him. \"Mr. Dumas,\" he said, \"your wife isn't here yet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You know her?\" the hunter asked. \"Oh, no,\" Maples said, and shook his head. \"No, I don't.\" He spread his legs and swiveled his hips as if stretching before a footrace. \"But I've read about her.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter watched as a tall, remarkably thin man stepped through the front door. Hollows behind his jaw and beneath his eyes made him appear ancient and skeletalas if he were visiting from some other, leaner world. The chancellor approached the thin man, embraced him, and held him for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That's President O'Brien,\" Maples said. \"A famous man, actually, to people who follow those sorts of things. So terrible, what happened to his family.\" Maples stabbed the ice in his drink with his straw.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first time the hunter began to think he should not have come.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Have you read your wife's books?\" Maples asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter nodded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In her poems her husband is a hunter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I guide hunters.\" He was looking out the window to where snow was settling on the hedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Does that ever bother you?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Killing animals. For a living, I mean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter watched snowflakes disappear as they touched the window. Was that what hunting meant to people? Killing animals? He put his fingers to the glass. \"No,\" he said. \"It doesn't bother me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter met his wife in Great Falls, Montana, in the winter of 1972. That winter arrived all at onceyou could watch it come. Twin curtains of white appeared in the north, white all the way to the sky, driving south like the end of all things. Cattle galloped the fencelines, bawling. Trees toppled; a barn roof tumbled over the highway. The river changed directions. The wind flung thrushes screaming into the gorse and impaled them on the thorns in grotesque attitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was a magician's assistant, beautiful, fifteen years old, an orphan. It was not a new story: a glittery red dress, long legs, a traveling magic show performing in the meeting hall at the Central Christian Church. The hunter had been walking past with an armful of groceries when the wind stopped him in his tracks and drove him into the alley behind the church. He had never felt such wind; it had him pinned. His face was pressed against a low window, and through it he could see the show. The magician was a small man in a dirty blue cape. Above him a sagging banner read THE GREAT VESPUCCI. But the hunter watched only the girl; she was graceful, young, smiling. Like a wrestler, the wind held him against the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magician was buckling the girl into a plywood coffin, which was painted garishly with red and blue bolts of lightning. Her neck and head stuck out at one end, her ankles and feet at the other. She beamed; no one had ever before smiled so broadly at being locked into a coffin. The magician started up an electric saw and brought it noisily down through the center of the box, sawing her in half. Then he wheeled her apart, her legs going one way, her torso another. Her neck fell back, her smile faded, her eyes showed only white. The lights dimmed. A child screamed. Wiggle your toes, the magician ordered, flourishing his magic wand, and she did; her disembodied toes wiggled in glittery high-heeled pumps. The audience squealed with delight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter watched her pink, fine-boned face, her hanging hair, her outstretched throat. Her eyes caught the spotlight. Was she looking at him? Did she see his face pressed against the window, the wind slashing at his neck, the groceriesonions, a sack of flourtumbled to the ground around his feet?\n",
    "\n",
    "She was beautiful to him in a way that nothing else had ever been beautiful. Snow blew down his collar and drifted around his boots. After some time the magician rejoined the severed box halves, unfastened the buckles, and fluttered his wand, and she was whole again. She climbed out of the box and curtsied in her glittering dress. She smiled as if it were the Resurrection itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the storm brought down a pine tree in front of the courthouse, and the power winked out, streetlight by streetlight. Before she could move, before the ushers could begin escorting the crowd out with flashlights, the hunter was slinking into the hall, making for the stage, calling for her.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was thirty years old, twice her age. She smiled at him, leaned over from the dais in the red glow of the emergency exit lights, and shook her head. \"Show's over,\" she said. In his pickup he trailed the magician's van through the blizzard to her next show, a library fundraiser in Butte. The next night he followed her to Missoula. He rushed to the stage after each performance. \"Just eat dinner with me,\" he'd plead. \"Just tell me your name.\" It was hunting by persistence. She said yes in Bozeman. Her name was plain, Mary Roberts. They had rhubarb pie in a hotel restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I know how you do it,\" he said. \"The feet in the box are dummies. You hold your legs against your chest and wiggle the dummy feet with a string.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She laughed. \"Is that what you do? Follow a girl from town to town to tell her her magic isn't real?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" he said. \"I hunt.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And when you're not hunting?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I dream about hunting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She laughed again. \"It's not funny,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You're right,\" she said, and smiled. \"It's not funny. I'm that way with magic. I dream about it. Even when I'm not asleep.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked into his plate, thrilled. He searched for something he might say. They ate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But I dream bigger dreams, you know,\" she said afterward, after she had eaten two pieces of pie, carefully, with a spoon. Her voice was quiet and serious. \"I have magic inside of me. I'm not going to get sawed in half by Tony Vespucci all my life.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't doubt it,\" the hunter said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I knew you'd believe me,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the next winter Vespucci brought her back to Great Falls and sawed her in half in the same plywood coffin. And the winter after that. Both times, after the performance, the hunter took her to the Bitterroot Diner, where he watched her eat two pieces of pie. The watching was his favorite part: a hitch in her throat as she swallowed, the way the spoon slid cleanly out from her lips, the way her hair fell over her ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then she was eighteen, and after pie she let him drive her to his cabin, forty miles from Great Falls, up the Missouri and then east into the Smith River valley. She brought only a small vinyl purse. The truck skidded and sheered as he steered it over the unploughed roads, fishtailing in the deep snow, but she didn't seem afraid or worried about where he might be taking her, about the possibility that the truck might sink in a drift, that she might freeze to death in her pea coat and glittery magician's-assistant dress. Her breath plumed out in front of her. It was twenty degrees below zero. Soon the roads would be snowed over, impassable until spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "At his one-room cabin, with furs and old rifles on the walls, he unbolted the door to the crawl space and showed her his winter hoard: a hundred smoked trout, plucked pheasants and venison quarters hanging frozen from hooks. \"Enough for two of me,\" he said. She scanned his books over the fireplacea monograph on grouse habits, a series of journals on upland game birds, a thick tome titled simply Bear. \"Are you tired?\" he asked. \"Would you like to see something?\" He gave her a snowsuit, strapped her boots into a pair of leather snowshoes, and took her to hear the grizzly. She wasn't bad on snowshoes, a little clumsy. They went creaking over wind-scalloped snow in the nearly unbearable cold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bear denned every winter in the same hollow cedar, the top of which had been shorn off by a storm. Black, three-fingered, and huge, in the starlight it resembled a skeletal hand thrust up from the ground, a ghoulish visitor scrabbling its way out of the underworld. They knelt. Above them the stars were knife points, hard and white. \"Put your ear here,\" he whispered. The breath that carried his words crystallized and blew away. They listened, face-to-face, their ears over woodpecker holes in the trunk. She heard it after a minute, tuning her ears in to something like a drowsy sigh, a long exhalation of slumber. Her eyes widened. A full minute passed. She heard it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We can see him,\" he whispered, \"but we have to be dead quiet. Grizzlies are light hibernators. Sometimes all you do is step on twigs outside their dens and they're up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He began to dig at the snow. She stood back, her mouth open, eyes wide. Bent at the waist, the hunter bailed the snow back through his legs. He dug down three feet and then encountered a smooth, icy crust covering a large hole in the base of the tree. Gently he dislodged plates of ice and lifted them aside. From the hole the smell of bear came to her, like wet dog, like wild mushrooms. The hunter removed some leaves. Beneath was a shaggy flank, a patch of brown fur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He's on his back,\" the hunter whispered. \"This is his belly. His forelegs must be up here somewhere.\" He pointed to a place higher on the trunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "She put one hand on his shoulder and knelt in the snow beside the den. Her eyes were wide and unblinking. Her jaw hung open. Above her shoulder a star separated itself from a galaxy and melted through the sky. \"I want to touch him,\" she said. Her voice sounded loud and out of place in that wood, under the naked cedars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hush,\" he whispered. He shook his head no.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Just for a minute.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" he hissed. \"You're crazy.\" He tugged at her arm. She removed the mitten from her other hand with her teeth and reached down. He pulled at her again but lost his footing and fell back, clutching an empty mitten. As he watched, horrified, she turned and placed both hands, spread-fingered, in the thick shag of the bear's chest. Then she lowered her face, as if drinking from the snowy hollow, and pressed her lips to the bear's chest. Her entire head was inside the tree. She felt the soft silver tips of fur brush her cheeks. Against her nose one huge rib flexed slightly. She heard the lungs fill and then empty. She heard blood slug through veins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Want to know what he dreams?\" she asked. Her voice echoed up through the tree and poured from the shorn ends of its hollowed branches. The hunter took his knife from his coat. \"Summer,\" her voice echoed. \"Blackberries. Trout. Dredging his flanks across river pebbles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'd have liked,\" she said later, back in the cabin as he built up the fire, \"to crawl all the way down there with him. Get into his arms. I'd grab him by the ears and kiss him on the eyes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter watched the fire, the flames cutting and sawing, each log a burning bridge. Three years he had waited for this. Three years he had dreamed this girl by his fire. But somehow it had ended up different from what he had imagined. He had thought it would be like a huntlike waiting hours beside a wallow with his rifle barrel on his pack to see the huge antlered head of a bull elk loom up against the sky, to hear the whole herd behind him inhale and then scatter down the hill. If you had your opening you shot and walked the animal down and that was it. But this felt different. It was exactly as if he were still three years younger, stopped outside the Central Christian Church and driven against a low window by the wind or some other, greater force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Stay with me,\" he whispered to her, to the fire. \"Stay the winter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruce Maples stood beside him, jabbing the ice in his drink with his straw. \"I'm in athletics,\" he offered. \"I run the athletic department here.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You mentioned that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Did I? I don't remember. I used to coach track. Hurdles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter was watching the thin, stricken man, President O'Brien, as he stood in the corner of the reception room. Every few minutes a couple of guests made their way to him and took O'Brien's hands in their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You probably know,\" the hunter told Maples, \"that wolves are hurdlers. Sometimes the people who track them will come to a snag and the prints will disappear. As if the entire pack just leaped into a tree and vanished. Eventually they'll find the tracks again, thirty or forty feet away. People used to think it was magicflying wolves. But all they did was jump. One great coordinated leap.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Maples was looking around the room. \"Huh,\" he said. \"I wouldn't know about that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She stayed. The first time they made love, she shouted so loudly that coyotes climbed onto the roof and howled down the chimney. He rolled off her, sweating. The coyotes coughed and chuckled all night, like children chattering in the yard, and he had nightmares. \"Last night you had three dreams, and you dreamed you were a wolf each time,\" she whispered. \"You were mad with hunger and running under the moon.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Had he dreamed that? He couldn't remember. Maybe he talked in his sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December it never got warmer than fifteen below. The river frozesomething he'd never seen. On Christmas Eve he drove all the way to Helena to buy her figure skates. In the morning they wrapped themselves head-to-toe in furs and went out to skate the river. She held him by the hips and they glided through the blue dawn, skating up the frozen coils and shoals, beneath the leafless alders and cottonwoods, only the bare tips of creek willows showing above the snow. Ahead of them vast white stretches of river faded into darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a wind-polished bend they came upon a dead heron, frozen by its ankles into the ice. It had tried to hack itself out, hammering with its beak first at the ice entombing its feet and then at its own thin and scaly legs. When it finally died, it died upright, wings folded back, beak parted in some final, desperate cry, legs like twin reeds rooted in the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "She fell to her knees beside the bird. In its eye she saw her face flatly reflected. \"It's dead,\" the hunter said. \"Come on. You'll freeze too.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" she said. She slipped off her mitten and closed the heron's beak in her fist. Almost immediately her eyes rolled back in her head. \"Oh, wow,\" she moaned. \"I can feel her.\" She stayed like that for whole minutes, the hunter standing over her, feeling the cold come up his legs, afraid to touch her as she knelt before the bird. Her hand turned white and then blue in the wind. Finally she stood. \"We have to bury it,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "That night she lay stiff and would not sleep. \"It was just a bird,\" he said, unsure of what was bothering her but bothered by it himself. \"We can't do anything for a dead bird. It was good that we buried it, but tomorrow something will find it and dig it out.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She turned to him. Her eyes were wide. He remembered how they had looked when she put her hands on the bear. \"When I touched her,\" she said, \"I saw where she went.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I saw where she went when she died. She was on the shore of a lake with other herons, a hundred others, all facing the same direction, and they were wading among stones. It was dawn, and they watched the sun come up over the trees on the other side of the lake. I saw it as clearly as if I were there.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He rolled onto his back and watched shadows shift across the ceiling. \"Winter is getting to you,\" he said. He resolved to make sure she went out every day. It was something he'd long believed: go out every day in winter, or your mind will slip. Every winter the paper was full of stories about ranchers' wives, snowed in and crazed with cabin fever, who had dispatched their husbands with cleavers or awls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winter threw itself at the cabin. He took her out every day. He showed her a thousand ladybugs hibernating in an orange ball hung in a riverbank hollow; a pair of dormant frogs buried in frozen mud, their blood crystallized until spring. He pried a globe of honeybees from its hive, slow-buzzing, stunned from the sudden exposure, tightly packed around the queen, each bee shimmying for warmth. When he placed the globe in her hands, she fainted, her eyes rolled back. Lying there, she saw all their dreams at once, the winter reveries of scores of worker bees, each one fiercely vivid: bright trails through thorns to a clutch of wild roses, honey tidily brimming a hundred combs.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each day she learned more about what she could do. She felt a foreign and keen sensitivity bubbling in her blood, as if a seed planted long ago were just now sprouting. The larger the animal, the more powerfully it could shake her. The recently dead were virtual mines of visions, casting them off with a slow-fading strength as if cutting a long series of tethers one by one. She pulled off her mittens and touched everything she could: bats, salamanders, a cardinal chick tumbled from its nest, still warm. Ten hibernating garter snakes coiled beneath a rock, eyelids sealed, tongues stilled. Each time she touched a frozen insect, a slumbering amphibian, anything just dead, her eyes rolled back and its visions, its heaven, went shivering through her body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their first winter passed like that. When he looked out the cabin window, he saw wolf tracks crossing the river, owls hunting from the trees, six feet of snow like a quilt ready to be thrown off. She saw burrowed dreamers nestled under roots against the long twilight, their dreams rippling into the sky like auroras.\n",
    "\n",
    "With love still lodged in his heart like a splinter, he married her in the first muds of spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruce Maples gasped when the hunter's wife finally arrived. She moved through the door like a show horse, demure in the way she kept her eyes down, but assured in her step; she brought each tapered heel down and struck it against the granite. The hunter had not seen his wife for twenty years, and she had changedbecome refined, less wild, and somehow, to the hunter, worse for it. Her face had wrinkled around the eyes, and she moved as if avoiding contact with anything near her, as if the hall table or the closet door might suddenly lunge forward to snatch at her lapels. She wore no jewelry, no wedding ring, only a plain black suit, double-breasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "She found her nametag on the table and pinned it to her lapel. Everyone in the reception room looked at her and then looked away. The hunter realized that she, not President O'Brien, was the guest of honor. In a sense they were courting her. This was their way, the chancellor's waya silent bartender, tuxedoed coat girls, big icy drinks. Give her pie, the hunter thought. Rhubarb pie. Show her a sleeping grizzly.\n",
    "\n",
    "They sat for dinner at a narrow and very long table, fifteen or so high-backed chairs down each side and one at each end. The hunter was seated several places away from his wife. She looked over at him finally, a look of recognition, of warmth, and then looked away again. He must have seemed old to herhe must always have seemed old to her. She did not look at him again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kitchen staff, in starched whites, brought onion soup, scampi, poached salmon. Around the hunter guests spoke in half whispers about people he did not know. He kept his eyes on the windows and the blowing snow beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The river thawed and drove huge saucers of ice toward the Missouri. The hunter felt that old stirring, that quickening in his soul, and would rise in the wide pink dawns, grab his fly rod, and hurry down to the river. Already trout were rising through the chill brown water to take the first insects of spring. Soon the telephone in the cabin was ringing with calls from clients, and his guiding season was on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April an occasional client wanted a mountain lion or a trip with dogs for birds, but late spring and summer were for trout. He was out every morning before dawn, driving with a thermos of coffee to pick up a lawyer, a widower, a politician with a penchant for wild cutthroat. He came home stinking of fish guts and woke her with eager storiesnative trout leaping fifteen-foot cataracts, a stubborn rainbow wedged under a snag.\n",
    "\n",
    "By June she was bored and lonely. She wandered through the forest, but never very far. The summer woods were dense and busy, not like the quiet graveyard feel of winter. Nothing slept for very long; everything was emerging from cocoons, winging about, buzzing, multiplying, having litters, gaining weight. Bear cubs splashed in the river. Chicks screamed for worms. She longed for the stillness of winter, the long slumber, the bare sky, the bone-on-bone sound of bull elk knocking their antlers against trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In September the big-game hunters came. Each client wanted something different: elk, antelope, a bull moose, a doe. They wanted to see grizzlies, track a wolverine, shoot sandhill cranes. They wanted the heads of seven-by-seven royal bulls for their dens. Every few days he came home smelling of blood, with stories of stupid clients, of the Texan who sat, wheezing, too out of shape to get to the top of a hill for his shot. A bloodthirsty New Yorker claimed he wanted only to photograph black bears; then he pulled a pistol from his boot and fired wildly at two cubs and their mother. Nightly she scrubbed blood out of the hunter's coveralls, watched it fade from rust to red to rose in a basin filled with river water.\n",
    "\n",
    "She began to sleep, taking long afternoon naps, three hours or more. Sleep, she learned, was a skill like any other, like getting sawed in half and reassembled, or like divining visions from a dead robin. She taught herself to sleep despite heat, despite noise. Insects flung themselves at the screens, hornets sped down the chimney, the sun angled hot and urgent through the southern windows; still she slept. When he came home each autumn night, exhausted, forearms stained with blood, she was hours into sleep. Outside, the wind was already stripping leaves from the cottonwoodstoo soon, he thought. He'd take her sleeping hand. Both of them lived in the grip of forces they had no control overthe October wind, the revolutions of the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "That winter was the worst he could remember: from Thanksgiving on they were snowed in, the truck buried under six-foot drifts. The phone line went down in December and stayed down until April. January began with a chinook followed by a terrible freeze. The next morning a three-inch crust of ice covered the snow. On the ranches to the south cattle crashed through and bled to death kicking their way out. Deer punched through with their tiny hooves and suffocated in the deep snow beneath. Trails of blood veined the hills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mornings he would find coyote tracks written in the snow around the door to the crawl space, two inches of hardwood between them and all his winter hoard hanging frozen beneath the floorboards. He reinforced the door with baking sheets, nailing them up against the wood and over the hinges. Twice he woke to the sound of claws scrabbling against the metal and charged outside to shout the coyotes away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everywhere he looked something was dying: an elk keeling over, an emaciated doe clattering onto ice like a drunken skeleton. The radio reported huge cattle losses on the southern ranches. Each night he dreamt of wolves, of running with them, soaring over fences and tearing into the steaming carcasses of cattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February he woke to coyotes under the cabin. He grabbed his bow and knife and dashed out into the snow barefoot, his feet going numb. They had gone in under the door, chewing and digging the frozen earth under the foundation. He unbolted what was left of the door and swung it free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elk arrows were all he had, aluminum shafts tipped with broadheads. He squatted in the dark entrancetheir only exitwith his bow at full draw and an arrow nocked. Above him he could hear his wife's feet pad quietly over the floorboards. A coyote made a coughing sound. Others shifted and panted. Maybe there were ten. He began to fire arrows steadily into the dark. He heard some bite into the foundation blocks at the back of the crawl space, others sink into flesh. He spent his whole quiver: a dozen arrows. The yelps of speared coyotes went up. A few charged him, and he lashed at them with his knife. He felt teeth go to the bone of his arm, felt hot breath on his cheeks. He lashed with his knife at ribs, tails, skulls. His muscles screamed. The coyotes were in a frenzy. Blood bloomed from his wrist, his thigh.\n",
    "\n",
    "She heard the otherworldly screams of wounded coyotes come up through the floorboards, his grunts and curses as he fought. It sounded as if an exit had been tunneled all the way from hell to open under their house, and what was now pouring out was the worst violence that place could send up. She knelt in front of the fireplace and felt the souls of coyotes as they came through the boards on their way skyward.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was blood-soaked and hungry, and his thigh had been badly bitten, but he worked all day digging out the truck. If he did not get food, they would starve, and he tried to hold the thought of the truck in his mind. He lugged slate and tree bark to wedge under the tires, excavated a mountain of snow from the truck bed. Finally, after dark, he got the engine turned over and ramped the truck up onto the frozen, wind-crusted snow. For a brief, wonderful moment he had it careening over the icy crust, starlight washing through the windows, tires spinning, pistons churning, what looked to be the road unspooling in the headlights. Then he crashed through. Slowly, painfully, he began digging it out again.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was hopeless. He would get it up, and then it would break through a few miles later. Hardly anywhere was the sheet of ice atop the snow thick enough to support the truck's weight. For twenty hours he dug and then revved and slid the truck over eight-foot drifts. Three more times it crashed through and sank to the windows. Finally he left it. He was ten miles from home, thirty miles from town.\n",
    "\n",
    "He made a weak and smoky fire with cut boughs and lay beside it and tried to sleep, but he couldn't. The heat from the fire melted snow, and trickles ran slowly toward him but froze solid before they reached him. The stars twisting in their constellations above had never seemed farther or colder. In a state that was neither fully sleep nor fully waking, he watched wolves lope around his fire, just outside the reaches of light, slavering and lean. He thought for the first time that he might die if he did not get warmer. He managed to kneel and turn and crawl for home. Around him he could feel the wolves, smell blood on them, hear their nailed feet scrape across the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "He traveled all that night and all the next day, near catatonia, sometimes on his feet, more often on his elbows and knees. At times he thought he was a wolf, and at times he thought he was dead. When he finally made it to the cabin, there were no tracks on the porch, no sign that she had gone out. The crawl-space door was still flung open, and shreds of the siding and the doorframe lay scattered about.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was kneeling on the floor, ice in her hair, lost in some kind of hypothermic torpor. With his last dregs of energy he constructed a fire and poured a mug of hot water down her throat. As he fell into sleep, he watched himself as from a distance, weeping and clutching his near-frozen wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "They had only flour and a few crackers in the cupboards. When she could speak, her voice was quiet and far away. \"I have dreamt the most amazing things,\" she murmured. \"I have seen the places where coyotes go when they are gone. I know where spiders go, and geese ... \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow fell incessantly. Night was abiding; daylight passed in a breath. The hunter was beyond hungry. Whenever he stood up, his eyesight fled in slow, nauseating streaks of color. He went out with lanterns to fish, shoveled down to the river ice, chopped through it with a maul, and shivered over the hole jigging a ball of dough on a hook. Sometimes he brought back a trout; other times they ate a squirrel, a hare, once a famished deer whose bones he cracked and boiled, or only a few handfuls of rose hips. In the worst parts of March he dug out cattails to peel and steam the tubers.\n",
    "\n",
    "She hardly ate, sleeping eighteen, twenty hours a day. When she woke, it was to scribble on notebook paper before plummeting back into sleep, clutching at the blankets as if they gave her sustenance. There was, she was learning, strength hidden at the center of weakness, ground at the bottom of the deepest pit. With her stomach empty and her body quieted, without the daily demands of living, she felt she was making important discoveries. She was only nineteen and had lost twenty pounds since marrying him. Naked, she was all rib cage and pelvis.\n",
    "\n",
    "He read her scribbled dreams, but they seemed to be senseless poems and gave him no clues to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snail: sleds down stones in the rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owl: fixes his eyes on hare, drops as if from the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horse: rides across the plains with his brothers ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In April the temperature rose above zero and then above twenty. He strapped an extra battery to his pack and went to dig out the truck. Its excavation took all day. He drove it slowly back up the slushy road in the moonlight and asked if she'd like to go to town the next morning. To his surprise, she said yes. They heated water for baths and dressed in clothes they hadn't worn in six months. She threaded twine through her belt loops to keep her trousers up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the wheel his chest filled to have her with him, to be moving out into the country, to see the sun above the trees. Spring was coming; the valley was dressing up. Look there, he wanted to say, those geese streaming over the road. The valley lives. Even after a winter like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "She asked him to drop her off at the library. He bought fooda dozen frozen pizzas, potatoes, eggs, carrots. He nearly wept at seeing bananas. In the parking lot he drank a half gallon of milk. When he picked her up at the library, she had applied for a library card and borrowed twenty books. They stopped at the Bitterroot for hamburgers and rhubarb pie. She ate three pieces. He watched her eat, the spoon sliding out of her mouth. This was better. This was more like his dreams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, Mary,\" he said, \"I think we made it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I love pie,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the line was repaired, the phone began to ring. He took his fishing clients down the river. She sat on the porch, reading, reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon her sudden and ravenous appetite for books could not be met by the Great Falls Public Library. She wanted other booksessays about sorcery, primers on magic-working and conjury that had to be mail-ordered from New Hampshire, New Orleans, even Italy. Once a week the hunter drove to town to collect a parcel of books from the post office: Arcana Mundi, The Seer's Dictionary, Paragon of Wizardry, Occult Science Among the Ancients. He opened one to a random page and read \"Bring water, tie a soft fillet around your altar, burn it on fresh twigs and frankincense ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She regained her health, took on energy, no longer lay under furs dreaming all day. She was out of bed before he was, brewing coffee, her nose already between pages. With a steady diet of meat and vegetables her body bloomed, her hair shone, her eyes and cheeks glowed. How beautiful she seemed to him in those few hours he was home. After supper he would watch her read in the firelight, blackbird feathers tied all through her hair, a heron's beak hanging between her breasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In November he took a Sunday off and they cross-country skied. They came across a bull elk frozen to death in a draw. Ravens shrieked at them as they skied to it. She knelt and put her palm on the leathered skull. \"There,\" she moaned. \"I feel him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What do you feel?\" he asked, standing behind her. \"What is it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She stood, trembling. \"I feel his life flowing out,\" she said. \"I see where he goes, what he sees.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But that's impossible,\" he said. \"It's like saying you know what I dream.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I do,\" she said. \"You dream about wolves.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But that elk's been dead at least a day. It doesn't go anywhere. It goes into the crops of those ravens.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How could she tell him? How could she ask him to understand such a thing? How could anyone understand? More clearly than ever she could see that there was a fine line between dreams and wakefulness, between living and dying, a line so tenuous it sometimes didn't exist. It was always clearest for her in winter. In winter, in that valley, life and death were not so different. The heart of a hibernating newt was frozen solid, but she could warm and wake it in her palm. For the newt there was no line at all, no fence, no River Styx, only an area between living and dying, like a snowfield between two lakes: a place where dreams and wakefulness met, where death was only a possibility and visions rose shimmering to the stars like smoke. All that was needed was a hand, the heat of a palm, the touch of fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That February the sun shone during the days and ice formed at nightslick sheets glazing the wheat fields, the roofs and roads. One day he dropped her off at the library, the chains on the tires rattling as he pulled away, heading back up the Missouri toward Fort Benton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around noon Marlin Spokes, a snowplough driver the hunter knew from grade school, slid off the Sun River Bridge in his plough and dropped forty feet into the river. He was dead before they could get him out of the truck. She was reading in the library, a block away, and heard the plough crash into the riverbed like a thousand dropped girders. When she got to the bridge, sprinting in her jeans and T-shirt, men were already in the watera telephone man from Helena, a jeweler, a butcher in his apron, all of them had scrambled down the banks and were wading in the rapids, prying the door open. The men lifted Marlin from the cab, stumbling as they carried him. Steam rose from their shoulders and from the crushed hood of the plough. She careened down the snow-covered slope and splashed to them. Her hand on the jeweler's arm, her leg against the butcher's leg, she reached for Marlin's ankle.\n",
    "\n",
    "When her finger touched Marlin's body, her eyes rolled back and a single vision leaped to her: Marlin Spokes pedaling a bicycle, a child's seat mounted over the rear tire with a helmeted boyMarlin's own sonstrapped into it. Spangles of light drifted over the riders as they rolled down a lane beneath giant, sprawling maples. The boy reached for Marlin's hair with one small fist. In the glass of a storefront window their reflection flashed past. Fallen leaves turned over in their wake. This quiet visionlike a ribbon of rich silkran out slowly and fluidly, with great power, and she shook beneath it. It was she who pedaled the bike. The boy's fingers pulled through her hair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The men who were touching her or touching Marlin saw what she saw, felt what she felt. At first they spoke of it only in their basements, at night, but Great Falls was not a big town, and this was not something one could keep locked in a basement. Soon they discussed it everywherein the supermarket, at the gasoline pumps. People who didn't know Marlin Spokes or his son or the hunter's wife or any of the men in the river that morning soon spoke of the event like experts. \"All you had to do was touch her,\" a barber said, \"and you saw it too.\" \"The most beautiful lane you've ever dreamed,\" a deli owner raved. \"You didn't just pedal his son around,\" movie ushers whispered, \"you loved him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He could have heard anywhere. In the cabin he built up the fire, flipped idly through a stack of her books. He couldn't understand themone of them wasn't even in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "After dinner she took the plates to the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You read Spanish now?\" he asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her hands in the sink stilled. \"It's Portuguese,\" she said. \"I understand only a little.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He turned his fork in his hands. \"Were you there when Marlin Spokes was killed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I helped pull him out of the truck. I don't think I was much good.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked at the back of her head. He felt like driving his fork through the table. \"What tricks did you play? Did you hypnotize people?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Her shoulders tightened. Her voice came out furious. \"Why can't you\" she began, but her voice fell off. \"It wasn't tricks,\" she muttered. \"I helped carry him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When she started to get phone calls, he hung up on the callers. But they were relentless: a grieving widow, an orphan's lawyer, a reporter from the Great Falls Tribune. A blubbering father drove all the way to the cabin to beg her to come to the funeral parlor, and finally she went. The hunter insisted on driving her. It wasn't right, he declared, for her to go alone. He waited in the truck in the parking lot, engine rattling, radio moaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I feel so alive,\" she said afterward, as he helped her into the cab. Her clothes were soaked through with sweat. \"Like my blood is fizzing through my body.\" At home she lay awake, far away, all night.\n",
    "\n",
    "She got called back and called back, and each time he drove her. He would take her after a whole day of duck hunting and pass out from exhaustion while he waited in the truck. When he woke, she would be beside him, holding his hand, her hair damp, her eyes wild. \"You dreamt you were with the wolves and eating salmon,\" she said. \"They were washed up and dying on the shoals.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He drove them home over the dark fields. He tried to soften his voice. \"What do you do in there? What really?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I give them solace. I let them say good-bye to their loved ones. I help them know something they'd never otherwise know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" he said. \"I mean what kind of tricks? How do you do it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She turned her hands palms up. \"As long as they're touching me, they see what I see. Come in with me next time. Go in there and hold hands. Then you'll know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He said nothing. The stars above the windshield seemed fixed in their places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Families wanted to pay her; most wouldn't let her leave until they did. She would come out to the truck with fifty, a hundredonce four hundreddollars folded into her pocket. She began to go off for weekends, disappearing in the truck before he was up, a fearless driver. She knelt by roadkilla crumpled porcupine, a shattered deer. She pressed her palm to the truck's grille, where the husks of insects smoked. Seasons came and went. She was gone half the winter. Each of them was alone. They never spoke. On longer drives she was sometimes tempted to keep the truck pointed away and never return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first thaws he would go out to the river and try to lose himself in the rhythm of casting, in the sound of pebbles driven downstream, clacking together. But even fishing had become lonely for him. Everything, it seemed, was out of his handshis truck, his wife, the course of his own life.\n",
    "\n",
    "As hunting season came on, his mind wandered. He was botching killsgetting upwind of elk, or telling a client to unload and call it quits thirty seconds before a pheasant burst from cover. When a client missed his mark and pegged an antelope in the neck, the hunter berated him for being careless, knelt over its tracks, and clutched at the bloody snow. \"Do you understand what you've done?\" he shouted. \"How the arrow shaft will knock against the trees, how the animal will run and run, how the wolves will trot behind it to keep it from resting?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The client was red-faced, huffing. \"Wolves don't hunt here,\" the client said. \"There haven't been wolves here for twenty years.\"\n",

    "She was in Butte or Missoula when he discovered her money in a boot: six thousand dollars and change. He canceled his trips and stewed for two days, pacing the porch, sifting through her things, rehearsing his arguments. When she saw him, the sheaf of bills jutting from his shirt pocket, she stopped halfway to the door, her bag over her shoulder, her hair pulled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's not right,\" he said.\n",

    "She walked past him into the cabin. \"I'm helping people. I'm doing what I love. Can't you see how good I feel afterward?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You take advantage of them. They're grieving, and you take their money.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"They want to pay me,\" she shrieked. \"I help them see something they desperately want to see.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's a grift. A con.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She came back out on the porch. \"No,\" she said. Her voice was quiet and strong. \"This is real. As real as anything: the valley, the river, your trout hanging in the crawl space. I have a talent. A gift.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He snorted. \"A gift for hocus-pocus. For swindling widows out of their savings.\" He lobbed the money into the yard. The wind caught the bills and scattered them over the snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "She hit him, once, hard across the mouth. \"How dare you?\" she cried. \"You, of all people, should understand. You who dreams of wolves every night.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the months that followed, she left the cabin more frequently and for longer durations, visiting homes, accident sites, and funeral parlors all over central Montana. Finally she pointed the truck south and didn't turn back. They had been married five years.\n",

    "Twenty years later, in the Bitterroot Diner, he looked up at the ceiling-mounted television and there she was, being interviewed. She lived in Manhattan, had traveled the world, had written two books. She was in demand all over the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Do you commune with the dead?\" the interviewer asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" she said, \"I help people. I commune with the living. I give people peace.\"\n",

    "The hunter bought her books at the bookstore and read them in one night. She had written poems about the valley, written them to the animals: you rampant coyote, you glorious buck. She had traveled to Sudan to touch the backbone of a fossilized stegosaur, and wrote of her frustration when she divined nothing from it. A TV network flew her to Kamchatka to embrace the huge, shaggy neck of a mammoth as it was air-lifted from a glacier. She'd had better luck with that one, describing an entire herd slogging big-footed through a slushy tide, tearing at sea grass and flaring their ears to catch the sun. In a handful of poems there were even vague allusions to hima brooding, blood-soaked presence that hovered outside the margins like a storm on its way, like a killer hiding in the basement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter was fifty-eight years old. Twenty years was a long time. The valley had diminished slowly but perceptibly: roads came in, and the grizzlies left, seeking higher country. Loggers had thinned nearly every accessible stand of trees. Every spring runoff from logging roads turned the river chocolate-brown, and the soil from the old forests was being washed into the Missouri. In his cabin, bent over the table, he set aside her books, took a pencil, and wrote her a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week later a Federal Express truck drove all the way to the cabin. Inside the envelope was her response, on embossed stationery. The handwriting was hurried and efficient. I will be in Chicago, it said, day after tomorrow. Enclosed is a plane ticket. Feel free to come. Thank you for writing.\n",

    "After sherbet the chancellor called his guests into the reception room. Burning candles had been distributed around the room: on the sills, the banister, the mantel, the bookshelves. The bar had been taken down; in its place three caskets had been set on the carpet. A bit of snow that had fallen on the lidsthey must have been kept outsidewas melting, and drops ran onto the carpet, where they left dark circles. Around the caskets cushions had been placed on the floor. The hunter leaned against the entryway and watched guests drift uncomfortably into the room, some cradling coffee cups, others gulping at gin or vodka in deep tumblers. Eventually everyone settled on the floor in a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter's wife came in then, elegant in her dark suit. She knelt and motioned for O'Brien to sit beside her. His face was pinched and inscrutable. Again the hunter had the impression that he was not of this world but of a slightly leaner one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"President O'Brien,\" his wife said, \"I know this is difficult for you. Death can seem so final, like a blade dropped through the neck. But the nature of death is not at all final. It is not some dark cliff off which we leap. I hope to show you it is merely a fog, something we can peer into and out of, something we can know and face and not necessarily fear. By each life taken from our collective lives we are diminished. But even in death we have much to celebrate. It is only a transition, like so many others.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She moved into the circle and unfastened the lids of the caskets. From where he sat the hunter could not see inside. His wife's hands fluttered around her waist like birds. \"Think,\" she said. \"Think hard about something you would like resolved, some matter, gone now, in the grips of the past, which you wish you could take backperhaps with your daughters, a moment, a lost feeling, a desperate wish.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hunter closed his eyes. \"Think now,\" his wife was saying, \"of some wonderful moment, some fine and sunny minute you shared, your wife and daughters, all of you together.\" Her voice was lulling. Behind his eyelids the glow of the candles made an even orange wash. He knew her hands were reaching for whateverwhoeverlay in those caskets. Somewhere inside him he felt her extend across the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "His wife said more about beauty and loss being the same thing, about how they ordered the world, and he felt something happeninga strange warmth, a flitting presence, something dim and unsettling, like a feather brushed across the back of his neck. Hands on both sides of him reached for his hands. Fingers locked around his fingers. He wondered if she was hypnotizing him, but it didn't matter. He had nothing to fight off or snap out of. She was inside him now; she had reached across and was poking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her voice faded, and he felt himself swept up as if rising toward the ceiling. Air washed lightly in and out of his lungs; warmth pulsed in the hands that held his. In his mind he saw a sea emerging from fog. The water was broad and flat and glittered like polished metal. He could feel dune grass moving against his shins, and wind coming over his shoulders. All around him bees shuttled over the dunes. Far out a shorebird was diving for crabs. He knew that a few hundred yards away two girls were building castles in the sand; he could hear their song, soft and lilting. Their mother was with them, reclining under an umbrella, one leg bent, the other straight. She was drinking iced tea, and he could taste it in his mouth, sweet and bitter with a trace of mint. Each cell in his body seemed to breathe. He became the girls, the diving bird, the shuttling bees; he was the mother of the girls and the father; he could feel himself flowing outward, richly dissolving, paddling into the world like the very first cell into the great blue sea ...\n",
    "\n",
    "When he opened his eyes, he saw linen curtains, women in gowns kneeling. Tears were visible on many people's cheeksO'Brien's and the chancellor's and Bruce Maples's. His wife's head was bowed. The hunter gently released the hands that held his, stood, and walked out into the kitchen, past the sudsy sinks, the stacks of dishes. He let himself out a side door and found himself on the wooden deck that ran the length of the house, a couple of inches of snow already settled on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "He felt drawn toward the pond, the birdbath, the hedges. He walked to the pond and stood at its rim. The snow fell steadily, and the undersides of the clouds glowed with reflected light from the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before long his wife stepped onto the deck and came down to join him. There were things he had been preparing to say: something about a final belief, an expression of gratitude for providing a reason to leave the valley, if only for a night. He wanted to tell her that although the wolves were gone, may always have been gone, they still came to him in dreams. That they could run there, fierce and unfettered, was surely enough. She would understand. She had understood long before he did.\n",
    "\n",
    "But he was afraid to speak. He could see that speaking would be like dashing some very fragile bond to pieces, like kicking a dandelion gone to seed; the wispy, tenuous sphere of its body would scatter in the wind. So instead they stood together, the snow fluttering down from the clouds to melt into the water, where their reflected images trembled like two people trapped against the glass of a parallel world, and he reached, finally, to take her hand.\n",

    "          Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hark at the wind,\" said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Mate,\" replied the son.\n",

    "\"That's the worst of living so far out,\" balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; \"Of all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter.\"\n",

    "\"There he is,\" said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, \"Tut, tut!\" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Sergeant-Major Morris, \" he said, introducing him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sergeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Twenty-one years of it,\" said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. \"When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He don't look to have taken much harm.\" said Mrs. White politely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'd like to go to India myself,\" said the old man, just to look around a bit, you know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Better where you are,\" said the Sergeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,\" said the old man. \"what was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nothing.\" said the soldier hastily. \"Leastways, nothing worth hearing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Monkey's paw?\" said Mrs. White curiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps.\" said the Sergeant-Major off-handedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To look at,\" said the Sergeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, \"it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what is there special about it?\" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It had a spell put on it by an old Fakir,\" said the Sergeant-Major, \"a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, why don't you have three, sir?\" said Herbert White cleverly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth.\"I have,\" he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And did you really have the three wishes granted?\" asked Mrs. White.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I did,\" said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And has anybody else wished?\" persisted the old lady.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The first man had his three wishes. Yes,\" was the reply, \"I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you've had your three wishes it's no good to you now then Morris,\" said the old man at last. \"What do you keep it for?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The soldier shook his head. \"Fancy I suppose,\" he said slowly.\" I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you could have another three wishes,\" said the old man, eyeing him keenly,\" would you have them?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't know,\" said the other. \"I don't know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Better let it burn,\" said the soldier solemnly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you don't want it Morris,\" said the other, \"give it to me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I won't.\" said his friend doggedly. \"I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. \"How do you do it?\" he inquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud,\" said the Sergeant-Major, \"But I warn you of the consequences.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Sounds like the 'Arabian Nights'\", said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. \"Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you must wish,\" he said gruffly, \"Wish for something sensible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier's adventures in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,\" said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, \"we shan't make much out of it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Did you give anything for it, father?\" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A trifle,\" said he, colouring slightly, \"He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Likely,\" said Herbert, with pretended horror. \"Why, we're going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. \"I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact,\" he said slowly. It seems to me I've got all I want.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you!\" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. \"Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that'll just do it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I wish for two hundred pounds,\" said the old man distinctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It moved,\" he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. \"As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, I don't see the money,\" said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, \"and I bet I never shall.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It must have been your fancy, father,\" said his wife, regarding him anxiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "He shook his head. \"Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,\" said Herbert, as he bade them good night, \" and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I suppose all old soldiers are the same,\" said Mrs White. \"The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Might drop on his head from the sky,\" said the frivolous Herbert.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Morris said the things happened so naturally,\" said his father, \"that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well don't break into the money before I come back,\" said Herbert as he rose from the table. \"I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sergeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,\" she said as they sat at dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I dare say,\" said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \"but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You thought it did,\" said the old lady soothingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I say it did,\" replied the other. \"There was no thought about it; I had just - What's the matter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I - was asked to call,\" he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. \"I come from 'Maw and Meggins.' \"\n",
    "\n",
    "The old lady started. \"Is anything the matter?\" she asked breathlessly. \"Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Her husband interposed. \"There there mother,\" he said hastily. \"Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions. You've not brought bad news, I'm sure sir,\" and eyed the other wistfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'm sorry - \" began the visitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is he hurt?\" demanded the mother wildly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visitor bowed in assent.\"Badly hurt,\" he said quietly, \"but he is not in any pain.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh thank God!\" said the old woman, clasping her hands. \"Thank God for that! Thank - \"\n",
    "\n",
    "She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He was caught in the machinery,\" said the visitor at length in a low voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Caught in the machinery,\" repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,\"yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He sat staring out the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He was the only one left to us,\" he said, turning gently to the visitor. \"It is hard.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. \" The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\" he said, without looking round. \"I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There was no reply; the old woman\\92s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility,\" continued the other. \"They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, \"How much?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Two hundred pounds,\" was the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part III\n",
    "\n",
    "In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen - something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation - the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Come back,\" he said tenderly. \"You will be cold.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is colder for my son,\" said the old woman, and wept afresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"THE PAW!\" she cried wildly. \"THE MONKEY'S PAW!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He started up in alarm. \"Where? Where is it? What\\92s the matter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She came stumbling across the room toward him. \"I want it,\" she said quietly. \"You've not destroyed it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's in the parlour, on the bracket,\" he replied, marveling. \"Why?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I only just thought of it,\" she said hysterically. \"Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Think of what?\" he questioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The other two wishes,\" she replied rapidly. \"We've only had one.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Was not that enough?\" he demanded fiercely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No,\" she cried triumphantly; \"We'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs.\"Good God, you are mad!\" he cried aghast. \"Get it,\" she panted; \"get it quickly, and wish - Oh my boy, my boy!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. \"Get back to bed he said unsteadily. \"You don't know what you are saying.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We had the first wish granted,\" said the old woman, feverishly; \"why not the second?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A coincidence,\" stammered the old man.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Go get it and wish,\" cried his wife, quivering with excitement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. \"He has been dead ten days, and besides he - I would not tell you else, but - I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bring him back,\" cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. \"Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"WISH!\" she cried in a strong voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is foolish and wicked,\" he faltered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"WISH!\" repeated his wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "He raised his hand. \"I wish my son alive again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither spoke, but sat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"WHAT\\92S THAT?\" cried the old woman, starting up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A rat,\" said the old man in shaking tones - \"a rat. It passed me on the stairs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's Herbert!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are you going to do?\" he whispered hoarsely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's my boy; it's Herbert!\" she cried, struggling mechanically. \"I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For God's sake don't let it in,\" cried the old man, trembling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You're afraid of your own son,\" she cried struggling. \"Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman\\92s voice, strained and panting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The bolt,\" she cried loudly. \"Come down. I can't reach it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.\n",

    "          With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the\n",
    "city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. The rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In\n",
    "the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens\n",
    "and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved. Some were\n",
    "decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey, grave master workmen, quiet, merry\n",
    "women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked. In other streets the music beat faster, a\n",
    "shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance.\n",
    "Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights, over the\n",
    "music and the singing. All the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where on the\n",
    "great water-meadow called the Green' Fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with mudstained\n",
    "feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race. The\n",
    "horses wore no gear at all but a halter with\n",
    "Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time.\n",
    "Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the\n",
    "occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all. For instance, how about technology? I think that\n",
    "there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets; this follows from the fact that the\n",
    "people of Omelas are happy people. Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is\n",
    "necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the middle\n",
    "category, however  that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury,\n",
    "exuberance, etc. -- they could perfectly well have central heating, subway trains,. washing\n",
    "machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources,\n",
    "fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter.\n",
    "As you like it. I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming\n",
    "in to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double-decked\n",
    "trams, and that the train station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though\n",
    "plainer than the magnificent Farmers' Market. But even granted trains, I fear that Omelas so far\n",
    "strikes some of you as goody-goody. Smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. If so, please add an\n",
    "orgy. If an orgy would help, don't hesitate. Let us not, however, have temples from which issue\n",
    "beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man\n",
    "or woman, lover or stranger who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood, although that\n",
    "was my first idea. But really it would be better not to have any temples in Omelas  at least, not\n",
    "manned temples. Religion yes, clergy no. Surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about,\n",
    "offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh.\n",
    "Let them join the processions. Let tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the glory of\n",
    "desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) let the offspring of these\n",
    "delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all. One thing I know there is none of in Omelas\n",
    "is guilt. But what else should there be? I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is\n",
    "puritanical. For those who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of\n",
    "the city, drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then\n",
    "after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at last of the very arcana and inmost\n",
    "secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not\n",
    "habit-forming. For more modest tastes I think there ought to be beer. What else, what else\n",
    "belongs in the joyous city? The sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. But as we did\n",
    "without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right\n",
    "kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. A boundless and generous contentment, a\n",
    "magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the finest and\n",
    "fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer; this is what\n",
    "swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory they celebrate is that of life. I really\n",
    "don't think many of them need to take drooz.\n",
    "Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now. A marvelous smell of\n",
    "cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners. The faces of small children\n",
    "are amiably sticky; in the benign grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are\n",
    "entangled. The youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around the\n",
    "starting line of the course. An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a\n",
    "basket, and tall young men, wear her flowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten sits at\n",
    "the edge of the crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to listen, and they smile,\n",
    "but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark eyes\n",
    "wholly rapt in the sweet, thin magic of the tune.\n",
    "He finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute.\n",
    "As if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds from the\n",
    "pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear on their slender\n",
    "legs, and some of them neigh in answer. Sober-faced, the young riders stroke the horses' necks\n",
    "and soothe them, whispering, \"Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope. . . .\" They begin to form\n",
    "in rank along the starting line. The crowds along the racecourse are like a field of grass and\n",
    "flowers in the wind. The Festival of Summer has begun.\n",
    "Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe\n",
    "one more thing.\n",
    "In a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the\n",
    "cellar of one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no\n",
    "window. A little light seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards, secondhand from a\n",
    "cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. In one corner of the little room a couple of\n",
    "mops, with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling heads, stand near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a little\n",
    "damp to the touch, as cellar dirt usually is. The room is about three paces long and two wide: a\n",
    "mere broom closet or disused tool room. In the room a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl.\n",
    "It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective or\n",
    "perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It picks its nose and\n",
    "occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits haunched in the corner farthest\n",
    "from the bucket and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its\n",
    "eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will\n",
    "come. The door is always locked; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes-the child has\n",
    "no understanding of time or interval  sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, and a\n",
    "person, or several people, are there. One of them may come and kick the child to make it stand\n",
    "up. The others never come close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The food bowl\n",
    "and the water jug are hastily filled, the door is locked, the eyes disappear. The people at the door\n",
    "never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can remember\n",
    "sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks. \"I will be good,\" it says. \"Please let me out. I\n",
    "will be good!\" They never answer. The child used to scream for help at night, and cry a good\n",
    "deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining, \"eh-haa, eh-haa,\" and it speaks less and less often.\n",
    "It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal\n",
    "and grease a day. It is naked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its\n",
    "own excrement continually.\n",
    "They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it,\n",
    "others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them\n",
    "understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their\n",
    "city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars,\n",
    "the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their\n",
    "skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.\n",
    "This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever\n",
    "they seem capable of understanding; and most of those who come to see the child are young\n",
    "people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child. No matter how well\n",
    "the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators are always shocked and sickened\n",
    "at the sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves superior to. They feel anger,\n",
    "outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would like to do something for the child.\n",
    "But there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile\n",
    "place, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were\n",
    "done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and\n",
    "be destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in\n",
    "Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the\n",
    "chance of the happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.\n",
    "The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.\n",
    "Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen the\n",
    "child and faced this terrible paradox. They may brood over it for weeks or years. But as time\n",
    "goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good\n",
    "of its freedom: a little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. It is too\n",
    "degraded and imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. Its\n",
    "habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. Indeed, after so long it would\n",
    "probably be wretched without walls about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its own\n",
    "excrement to sit in. Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible\n",
    "justice of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and\n",
    "the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their\n",
    "lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not\n",
    "free. They know compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence,\n",
    "that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity\n",
    "of their science. It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They know that if\n",
    "the wretched one were not there snivelling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could\n",
    "make no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the\n",
    "first morning of summer.\n",
    "Now do you believe in them? Are they not more credible? But there is one more thing to\n",
    "tell, and this is quite incredible.\n",
    "At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to\n",
    "weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. Sometimes also a man or woman much older falls\n",
    "silent for a day or two, and then leaves home. These people go out into the street, and walk down\n",
    "the street alone. They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the\n",
    "beautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of Omelas. Each one goes alone, youth\n",
    "or girl man or woman. Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the\n",
    "houses with yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the fields. Each alone, they go\n",
    "west or north, towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the\n",
    "darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable\n",
    "to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not\n",
    "exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.\n",

    "     \"You've got to tell Wendy and Peter not to read any more on Africa.\"\n",

    "     \"It's got to be locked, that's all there is to it.\"\n",

    "     \"I don't know - I don't know,\" she said, blowing her nose, sitting down\n",
    "in a  chair that immediately began to rock and comfort  her. \"Maybe  I don't\n",

    "     \"That's just it. I feel like I don't belong here. The house is wife and\n",
    "mother now, and nursemaid. Can I compete with an African veldt? Can I give a\n",
    "bath and scrub the children as efficiently or quickly as the automatic scrub\n",
    "bath can?  I  cannot.  And it isn't just me. It's you. You've  been  awfully\n",

    "     \"I suppose I have been smoking too much.\"\n",
    "     \"You look as if you didn't know what to do with yourself in this house,\n",

    "     \"Am I?\" He paused and tried to feel into himself to see what was really\n",
    "there.\n",
    "     \"Oh, George!\"  She looked beyond him, at the nursery door. \"Those lions\n",
    "can't get out of there, can they?\"\n",
    "     He  looked at the  door  and saw it tremble as if something  had jumped\n",
    "against it from the other side.\n",
    "     \"Of course not,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "     At dinner they ate alone, for Wendy and Peter were at a special plastic\n",
    "carnival  across town and bad televised  home to say  they'd be  late, to go\n",
    "ahead eating. So George  Hadley, bemused, sat watching the dining-room table\n",
    "produce warm dishes of food from its mechanical interior.\n",
    "     \"We forgot the ketchup,\" he said.\n",
    "     \"Sorry,\" said a small voice within the table, and ketchup appeared.\n",
    "     As  for the nursery,  thought  George  Hadley,  it won't  hurt for  the\n",
    "children to be locked out of it awhile. Too much of anything  isn't good for\n",
    "anyone. And  it was clearly indicated that the  children had been spending a\n",
    "little too  much time on  Africa.  That sun. He could feel  it on  his neck,\n",
    "still, like a hot paw. And the lions. And the smell of blood. Remarkable how\n",
    "the nursery  caught the telepathic emanations  of the  children's minds  and\n",
    "created  life to  fill their  every desire. The children thought  lions, and\n",
    "there were lions. The children thought  zebras, and there were zebras. Sun -\n",
    "sun. Giraffes - giraffes. Death and death.\n",
    "     That last. He chewed tastelessly on the meat that the table bad cut for\n",
    "him. Death thoughts.  They  were awfully young, Wendy and  Peter, for  death\n",
    "thoughts.  Or,  no, you were never too young, really.  Long before  you knew\n",
    "what death was you were wishing it on someone else. When  you were two years\n",
    "old you were shooting people with cap pistols.\n",
    "     But this - the long, hot African veldt-the awful death in the jaws of a\n",
    "lion. And repeated again and again.\n",
    "     \"Where are you going?\"\n",
    "     He  didn't answer Lydia. Preoccupied,  be let the lights glow softly on\n",
    "ahead of him, extinguish behind  him as he  padded  to the nursery  door. He\n",
    "listened against it. Far away, a lion roared.\n",
    "     He unlocked  the door and opened it. Just before he stepped inside,  he\n",
    "heard a faraway scream. And then another roar from the lions, which subsided\n",
    "quickly.\n",
    "     He stepped into Africa. How  many  times in the last year had he opened\n",
    "this door and found Wonderland, Alice, the Mock  Turtle, or  Aladdin and his\n",
    "Magical  Lamp,  or Jack  Pumpkinhead of Oz,  or  Dr. Doolittle,  or  the cow\n",
    "jumping over a very real-appearing moon-all the delightful contraptions of a\n",
    "make-believe world. How often had he seen Pegasus flying in the sky ceiling,\n",
    "or seen fountains of red fireworks, or heard  angel voices singing. But now,\n",
    "is yellow hot Africa, this bake oven with  murder in the heat. Perhaps Lydia\n",
    "was right. Perhaps  they needed a little vacation from the fantasy which was\n",
    "growing a  bit  too  real for ten-year-old  children.  It  was  all right to\n",
    "exercise one's mind with gymnastic fantasies, but when the lively child mind\n",
    "settled  on one  pattern...  ? It seemed  that, at a  distance, for the past\n",
    "month, he had heard lions roaring, and smelled their strong  odor seeping as\n",
    "far away as his study door. But, being busy, he had paid it no attention.\n",
    "     George Hadley stood on the African grassland alone. The lions looked up\n",
    "from their feeding, watching him. The only flaw to the illusion was the open\n",
    "door  through which  he could see his wife, far down the dark  hall, like  a\n",
    "framed picture, eating her dinner abstractedly.\n",
    "     \"Go away,\" he said to the lions.\n",
    "     They did not go.\n",
    "     He knew the principle of the room exactly.  You sent out your thoughts.\n",
    "Whatever you thought would appear.  \"Let's  have Aladdin  and  his lamp,\" he\n",
    "snapped. The veldtland remained; the lions remained.\n",
    "     \"Come on, room! I demand Aladin!\" he said.\n",
    "     Nothing happened. The lions mumbled in their baked pelts.\n",
    "     \"Aladin!\"\n",
    "     He  went back  to  dinner. \"The fool room's out of order,\" he said. \"It\n",
    "won't respond.\"\n",
    "     \"Or--\"\n",
    "     \"Or what?\"\n",
    "     \"Or  it can't  respond,\" said Lydia, \"because the children have thought\n",
    "about Africa and lions and killing so many days that the room's in a rut.\"\n",
    "     \"Could be.\"\n",
    "     \"Or Peter's set it to remain that way.\"\n",
    "     \"Set it?\"\n",
    "     \"He may have got into the machinery and fixed something.\"\n",
    "     \"Peter doesn't know machinery.\"\n",
    "     \"He's a wise one for ten. That I.Q. of his -\"\n",
    "     \"Nevertheless -\"\n",
    "     \"Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.\"\n",
    "     The  Hadleys  turned. Wendy and Peter  were coming  in the front  door,\n",
    "cheeks like  peppermint candy, eyes like bright blue agate marbles,  a smell\n",
    "of ozone on their jumpers from their trip in the helicopter.\n",
    "     \"You're just in time for supper,\" said both parents.\n",
    "     \"We're full of strawberry  ice cream and  hot dogs,\" said the children,\n",
    "holding hands. \"But we'll sit and watch.\"\n",
    "     \"Yes, come tell us about the nursery,\" said George Hadley.\n",
    "     The  brother  and  sister  blinked  at  him  and then  at  each  other.\n",
    "\"Nursery?\"\n",
    "     \"All  about  Africa  and  everything,\"  said  the   father  with  false\n",
    "joviality.\n",
    "     \"I don't understand,\" said Peter.\n",
    "     \"Your  mother and  I were  just traveling through Africa  with rod  and\n",
    "reel; Tom Swift and his Electric Lion,\" said George Hadley.\n",
    "     \"There's no Africa in the nursery,\" said Peter simply.\n",
    "     \"Oh, come now, Peter. We know better.\"\n",
    "     \"I don't remember any Africa,\" said Peter to Wendy. \"Do you?\"\n",
    "     \"No.\"\n",
    "     \"Run see and come tell.\"\n",
    "     She obeyed\n",
    "     \"Wendy,  come  back here!\"  said George Hadley,  but she was gone.  The\n",
    "house lights followed her like a  flock of fireflies.  Too late, he realized\n",
    "he had forgotten to lock the nursery door after his last inspection.\n",
    "     \"Wendy'll look and come tell us,\" said Peter.\n",
    "     \"She doesn't have to tell me. I've seen it.\"\n",
    "     \"I'm sure you're mistaken, Father.\"\n",
    "     \"I'm not, Peter. Come along now.\"\n",
    "     But Wendy was back. \"It's not Africa,\" she said breathlessly.\n",
    "     \"We'll  see about this,\" said George  Hadley, and they all  walked down\n",
    "the hall together and opened the nursery door.\n",
    "     There  was  a green, lovely forest, a lovely river, a purple  mountain,\n",
    "high voices  singing, and  Rima, lovely and mysterious, lurking in the trees\n",
    "with  colorful flights of butterflies, like animated bouquets,  lingering in\n",
    "her  long  hair. The African veldtland  was gone. The lions were  gone. Only\n",
    "Rima was here now, singing a song so beautiful that it brought tears to your\n",
    "eyes.\n",
    "     George Hadley  looked in at the changed scene. \"Go to bed,\" he said  to\n",
    "the children.\n",
    "     They opened their mouths.\n",
    "     \"You heard me,\" he said.\n",
    "     They  went off to the  air  closet, where a wind sucked them like brown\n",
    "leaves up the flue to their slumber rooms.\n",
    "     George Hadley walked  through the singing glade and picked up something\n",
    "that lay in  the comer near where the  lions had been. He walked slowly back\n",
    "to his wife.\n",
    "     \"What is that?\" she asked.\n",
    "     \"An old wallet of mine,\" he said.\n",
    "     He showed it to her. The smell  of hot grass was on it and the smell of\n",
    "a lion. There were drops of saliva on it, it bad been chewed, and there were\n",
    "blood smears on both sides.\n",
    "     He closed the nursery door and locked it, tight.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In the middle of the night he was still awake and he knew  his wife was\n",
    "awake. \"Do you think Wendy changed it?\" she said at last, in the dark room.\n",
    "     \"Of course.\"\n",
    "     \"Made it from  a  veldt into a forest  and put  Rima  there instead  of\n",
    "lions?\"\n",
    "     \"Yes.\"\n",
    "     \"Why?\"\n",
    "     \"I don't know. But it's staying locked until I find out.\"\n",
    "     \"How did your wallet get there?\"\n",
    "     \"I don't  know  anything,\"  he said, \"except that I'm  beginning  to be\n",
    "sorry we bought that room for the children. If children are neurotic at all,\n",
    "a room like that -\"\n",
    "     \"It's  supposed to help them work  off  their  neuroses in a  healthful\n",
    "way.\"\n",
    "     \"I'm starting to wonder.\" He stared at the ceiling.\n",
    "     \"We've  given  the children everything they ever  wanted. Is  this  our\n",

    "     \"Who was it  said,  'Children are  carpets,  they should be  stepped on\n",
    "occasionally'? We've never lifted a hand. They're insufferable - let's admit\n",
    "it. They  come and go when they like; they treat us as if we were offspring.\n",
    "They're spoiled and we're spoiled.\"\n",
    "     \"They've been  acting funny ever since you  forbade them  to  take  the\n",

    "     \"They're not old enough to do that alone, I explained.\"\n",
    "     \"Nevertheless,  I've  noticed  they've been  decidedly  cool toward  us\n",

    "     \"I have a feeling it'll be Africa again before then.\"\n",
    "     A moment later they heard the screams.\n",
    "     Two screams. Two people screaming from  downstairs. And then  a roar of\n",
    "lions.\n",
    "     \"Wendy and Peter aren't in their rooms,\" said his wife.\n",
    "     He lay  in  his bed  with his beating  heart. \"No,\" he  said.  \"They've\n",

    "     \"Do they?\"\n",
    "     \"Yes, awfully.\"\n",
    "     And although  their beds tried very  bard, the two  adults  couldn't be\n",
    "rocked to sleep for another hour. A smell of cats was in the night air.\n",
    "\n",
    "     \"Father?\" said Peter.\n",
    "     \"Yes.\"\n",
    "     Peter looked at his shoes. He never looked  at his father any more, nor\n",

    "     \"That all depends.\"\n",
    "     \"On what?\" snapped Peter.\n",
    "     \"On you and your sister. If you  intersperse this  Africa with a little\n",
    "variety - oh, Sweden perhaps, or Denmark or China -\"\n",
    "     \"I thought we were free to play as we wished.\"\n",
    "     \"You are, within reasonable bounds.\"\n",
    "     \"What's wrong with Africa, Father?\"\n",
    "     \"Oh, so now you admit you have been conjuring up Africa, do you?\"\n",
    "     \"I wouldn't want the nursery locked up,\" said Peter coldly. \"Ever.\"\n",
    "     \"Matter  of  fact, we're thinking of  turning  the whole house  off for\n",
    "about a month. Live sort of a carefree one-for-all existence.\"\n",
    "     \"That  sounds  dreadful! Would I have  to tie my own shoes  instead  of\n",
    "letting the shoe tier do it? And brush my own teeth and  comb  my  hair  and\n",
    "give myself a bath?\"\n",
    "     \"It would be fun for a change, don't you think?\"\n",
    "     \"No, it would be horrid. I didn't like it when you took out the picture\n",

    "     \"That's because I wanted you to learn to paint all by yourself, son.\"\n",
    "     \"I don't want to do anything but look and listen and  smell;  what else\n",

    "\n",
    "     \"Am I on time?\" said David McClean.\n",

    "     \"David, you're a psychologist.\"\n",
    "     \"I should hope so.\"\n",
    "     \"Well, then, have a look at our nursery. You saw it a year ago when you\n",
    "dropped by; did you notice anything peculiar about it then?\"\n",
    "     \"Can't  say  I did;  the  usual violences, a  tendency toward  a slight\n",
    "paranoia  here or there, usual in children  because they feel  persecuted by\n",
    "parents constantly, but, oh, really nothing.\"\n",
    "     They walked down the  ball.  \"I  locked the nursery  up,\" explained the\n",
    "father, \"and  the children broke back  into it during  the night. I let them\n",
    "stay so they could form the patterns for you to see.\"\n",
    "     There was a terrible screaming from the nursery.\n",
    "     \"There it is,\" said George Hadley. \"See what you make of it.\"\n",
    "     They walked in on the children without rapping.\n",
    "     The screams had faded. The lions were feeding.\n",
    "     \"Run outside a moment, children,\" said George Hadley. \"No, don't change\n",
    "the mental combination. Leave the walls as they are. Get!\"\n",
    "     With the children gone, the two men stood  studying the lions clustered\n",
    "at a distance, eating with great relish whatever it was they had caught.\n",
    "     \"I wish I  knew  what  it was,\" said  George  Hadley.  \"Sometimes I can\n",

    "     David  McClean  laughed dryly.  \"Hardly.\" He turned to study  all  four\n",
    "walls. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n",
    "     \"A little over a month.\"\n",
    "     \"It certainly doesn't feel good.\"\n",
    "     \"I want facts, not feelings.\"\n",
    "     \"My dear George, a psychologist never  saw a fact in  his life. He only\n",
    "hears  about  feelings; vague  things.  This doesn't feel good, I  tell you.\n",
    "Trust my hunches and my instincts. I have a nose for something bad.  This is\n",
    "very bad. My advice to you is to have the whole damn room torn down and your\n",
    "children brought to me every day during the next year for treatment.\"\n",
    "     \"Is it that bad?\"\n",
    "     \"I'm afraid so. One of the original uses of these nurseries was so that\n",
    "we could study the patterns left on the  walls by the child's mind, study at\n",
    "our leisure, and  help the child. In this case, however, the room has become\n",
    "a channel toward-destructive thoughts, instead of a release away from them.\"\n",
    "     \"Didn't you sense this before?\"\n",
    "     \"I sensed  only that you bad spoiled your children more  than most. And\n",
    "now you're letting them down in some way. What way?\"\n",
    "     \"I wouldn't let them go to New York.\"\n",
    "     \"What else?\"\n",
    "     \"I've taken a few machines from the house and  threatened them, a month\n",
    "ago, with closing up the nursery unless they did their homework. I did close\n",
    "it for a few days to show I meant business.\"\n",
    "     \"Ah, ha!\"\n",
    "     \"Does that mean anything?\"\n",
    "     \"Everything.  Where  before  they  had  a Santa Claus now they  have  a\n",
    "Scrooge. Children prefer Santas. You've let this room and this house replace\n",
    "you  and your wife in  your children's affections. This room is their mother\n",
    "and  father, far more important in their lives than their  real parents. And\n",
    "now you come along  and want to shut it off. No wonder there's hatred  here.\n",
    "You can feel it coming out of the sky. Feel that sun. George, you'll have to\n",
    "change  your life.  Like too  many others,  you've built it  around creature\n",
    "comforts.  Why,  you'd starve  tomorrow  if  something  went  wrong in  your\n",
    "kitchen. You wouldn't know  bow to tap an egg. Nevertheless, turn everything\n",
    "off. Start new. It'll take time. But we'll make good children out of bad  in\n",
    "a year, wait and see.\"\n",
    "     \"But won't the shock be too much for the children, shutting the room up\n",
    "abruptly, for good?\"\n",
    "     \"I don't want them going any deeper into this, that's all.\"\n",
    "     The lions were finished with their red feast.\n",
    "     The lions were standing on the edge of  the  clearing watching the  two\n",
    "men.\n",
    "     \"Now I'm feeling persecuted,\"  said McClean. \"Let's  get out of here. I\n",

    "     \"Not that I know.\"\n",
    "     \"Some flaw in the machinery, a tampering or something?\"\n",
    "     \"No.\"\n",

    "and  swabbers and massagers, and  every other machine be could put  his hand\n",

    "     The house was full of dead bodies, it seemed. It felt like a mechanical\n",

    "to function at the tap of a button.\n",
    "     \"Don't let  them  do  it!\" wailed Peter  at  the ceiling,  as if he was\n",
    "talking to  the house, the nursery. \"Don't  let Father kill  everything.\" He\n",

    "     \"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!\" sang the children, smiling with wet faces.\n",

    "     \"I  think  we'd  better  get downstairs before those kids get engrossed\n",

      "b'\\r\\nJAIME HERNANDEZ\\r\\nYou have a girlfriend named Alma, who has a long tender horse neck and a big Dominican ass that seems to exist in a fourth dimension beyond jeans. An ass that could drag the moon out of orbit. An ass she never liked until she met you. Ain\\x92t a day that passes that you don\\x92t want to press your face against that ass or bite the delicate sliding tendons of her neck. You love how she shivers when you bite, how she fights you with those arms that are so skinny they belong on an after-school special.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlma is a Mason Gross student, one of those Sonic Youth, comic-book-reading alternatinas without whom you might never have lost your virginity. Grew up in Hoboken, part of the Latino community that got its heart burned out in the eighties, tenements turning to flame. Spent nearly every teen-age day on the Lower East Side, thought it would always be home, but then N.Y.U. and Columbia both said nyet, and she ended up even farther from the city than before. She is in a painting phase, and the people she paints are all the color of mold, look like they\\x92ve just been dredged from the bottom of a lake. Her last painting was of you, slouching against the front door: only your frowning I-had-a-lousy-Third-World-childhood-and-all-I-got-was-this-attitude eyes recognizable. She did give you one huge forearm. I told you I\\x92d get the muscles in. The past couple of weeks, now that the warm is here, Alma has abandoned black, started wearing these nothing dresses made out of what feels like tissue paper; it wouldn\\x92t take more than a strong wind to undress her. She says she does it for you: I\\x92m reclaiming my Dominican heritage (which ain\\x92t a complete lie\\x97she\\x92s even taking Spanish to better minister to your mom), and when you see her on the street, flaunting, flaunting, you know exactly what every nigger that walks by is thinking. You met at the weekly Latin parties at the DownUnder in New Brunswick. She never went to those parties, was dragged there by her high-school best friend, Patricia, who still listened to TKA, and this was how you got the chance to strike while, as your boys put it, the pussy was hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlma is slender as a reed, you a steroid-addicted block; Alma loves driving, you books; Alma owns a Saturn (bought for her by her carpenter father, who speaks only English in the house), you have no points on your license; Alma\\x92s nails are too dirty for cooking, your spaghetti con pollo is the best in the land. You are so very different\\x97she rolls her eyes every time you turn on the news and says she can\\x92t \\x93stand\\x94 politics. She won\\x92t even call herself Hispanic. She brags to her girls that you\\x92re a \\x93radical\\x94 and a real Dominican (even though on the Pl\\xe1tano Index you wouldn\\x92t rank, Alma being only the third Latina you\\x92ve ever really dated). You brag to your boys that she has more albums than any of them do, that she says terrible white-girl things while you fuck. She\\x92s more adventurous in bed than any girl you\\x92ve had; on your first date she asked you if you wanted to come on her tits or her face, and maybe during boy training you didn\\x92t get one of the memos but you were, like, umm, neither. And at least once a week she will kneel on the mattress before you and, with one hand pulling at her dark nipples, will play with herself, not letting you touch at all, fingers whisking the soft of her and her face looking desperately, furiously happy. She loves to talk while she\\x92s being dirty, too, will whisper, You like watching me don\\x92t you, you like listening to me come, and when she finishes lets out this long demolished groan and only then will she allow you to pull her into an embrace as she wipes her gummy fingers on your chest. This is me, she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes\\x97it\\x92s an opposites-attract sort of thing, it\\x92s a great-sex sort of thing, it\\x92s a no-thinking sort of thing. It\\x92s wonderful! Wonderful! Until one June day Alma discovers that you are also fucking this beautiful freshman girl named Laxmi, discovers the fucking of Laxmi because she, Alma, the girlfriend, opens your journal and reads. (Oh, she had her suspicions.) She waits for you on the stoop, and when you pull up in her Saturn and notice the journal in her hand your heart plunges through you like a fat bandit through a hangman\\x92s trap. You take your time turning off the car. You are overwhelmed by a pelagic sadness. Sadness at being caught, at the incontrovertible knowledge that she will never forgive you. You stare at her incredible legs and between them, to that even more incredible p\\xf3pola you\\x92ve loved so inconstantly these past eight months. Only when she starts walking over in anger do you finally step out. You dance across the lawn, powered by the last fumes of your outrageous sinverg\\xfcenzer\\xeda. Hey, mu\\xf1eca, you say, prevaricating to the end. When she starts shrieking, you ask her, Darling, what ever is the matter? She calls you:\\r\\n\\r\\na cocksucker\\r\\n\\r\\na punk motherfucker\\r\\n\\r\\na fake-ass Dominican.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe claims:\\r\\n\\r\\nyou have a little penis\\r\\n\\r\\nno penis\\r\\n\\r\\nand worst of all that you like curried pussy.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Which really is unfair, you try to say, since Laxmi is technically from Guyana, but Alma isn\\x92t listening.)\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of lowering your head and copping to it like a man, you pick up the journal as one might hold a baby\\x92s beshatted diaper, as one might pinch a recently be-nutted condom. You glance at the offending passages. Then you look at her and smile a smile your dissembling face will remember until the day you die.
